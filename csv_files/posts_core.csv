It's not part time, and if you work full time, you just found yourself another full time job on top. The volume of work is the same as if you were doing it full time which is overwhelming.

Springboard dictate the deadlines of assignments and examinations so there's no leeway in terms of extensions etc. They have set deadlines since they fund the project and the college has no say in how it will go on.

I submitted the application that just had a bunch of questions about my background and what I want to get into. A little bit later I got a response saying that they would want to call me for an interview and to take a technical assessment. I didn't pick up the call because I wasnt fully sure about the bootcamp. Nonetheless I tried out the technical assessment and answered 2/4 questions and stopped because I just got lazy and again I wasnt very onboard with the program despite applying. So I closed down my browser and let the time run out. Hours later I get an email and text saying ""Congratulations on your acceptance on the Software Engineering track"". The email was a bit more descriptive saying that I should go to their ""Foundations to Core"" path first which seems to be the basics before the meat of the program so I'm wondering if they just send these acceptance letters to anybody? 

I'm kind of intrigued now so I maybe want to add another discussion as to whether or not Springboard is good? I was about to enroll into Actualize coding bootcamp, but they teach Vue which is not bad per se, but I want to learn technologies that everyone says is more in demand like React.

From what I read around the subreddit, I heard the program is self paced and solo work where you learn through their lessons with no one else (no classmates) and then you have a mentor to help you along the way. Why does Springboard mention that there are cohorts on certain dates if we're we just learning on our own? If the solo learning is true, I think I'd prefer that more since I have some experience with self teaching coding. I don't want to go into a bootcamp and go through the absolute basics and there are people asking questions that I know the answer to.

I also see that job guarantee part of the program which I hear is a slippery slope for some bootcamps but am wondering how good Springboard is."

Chapter 148: Springboard

Vaughn had taken the extra time with the camera at Something Else Square, surveilling anyone who came back to the office from lunch and compiling a list of likely targets. Once he was done, he’d all but sprinted the short distance back to Warehouse Base. While it wasn’t far, he wasn’t a natural runner, managing more of an awkward shuffle. Once there, he dropped off his findings- handing the digital camera off to a startled Radio. “Print ‘em,” he demanded breathlessly. “I’ve gotta find someone- fast.”

“Hey,” Radio objected. “Did Emps die and make you king? Then-”

Vaughn rounded on the boy, towering on him by standing on tiptoes. “It’s important,” he said, voice surprisingly quiet, almost more terrifying than if he’d yelled. “-And you’ll do it. You’re the tech boy. Get the printer working, printing off of this camera, *now*.”

Radio scampered, and Vaughn followed silently in his wake, bringing his breathing under control and heading over to snag a pencil and scribble down fast notes about the surveillance photos he’d taken. As soon as he heard the printer’s gears whirr to life, he cut the notes short and stuck a roll of scotch tape to the index card- ‘*no apparent long-range option for destruction*,’ and stuck that in turn onto the paper, then a second index: *surveillance cameras*, and on the third: *sensors*, then, as the printer caught up with his writing, he switched to writing directly on the papers themselves. He flipped back through them, scribbling over the ones the shil’ had taken which included his face using a sharpie while the printer continued churning out the shots he’d taken. “Alright, Radio. Nuke the images off of there and get it ready for redeployment.”

“Sure thing, formatting it now…and done,” he announced. 

Vaughn ignored him and paged through the batch of surveillance shots as they printed. He counted out the pictures, then lifted the bundle of papers, slotting them into the manila envelope bound for Camp Death, marked them as “*Monument*,” and slapped his report onto the table, making Radio jump and almost fumble the camera.

Vaughn swooped down, Radio going instinctually still, like a mouse in the presence of a housecat. “I need to run something by you.”

“What…do you have in mind?”

“I need you to find me the most desperate person in this pile.” He tapped the pile of photos he’d taken.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A few minutes later, Radio was considerably more relaxed. Chatty, even.

“What about her? No ring, not terribly attractive. No man hanging around her, either.”

“A woman?” Vaughn considered Radio’s suggestion aloud. “Mark her down as a possibility, we’ll see what opportunity shapes up- see who we can follow from work,” he confirmed the decision. “That’s a good lead target. That kind of hair- high alcohol use and humidity causes it to frizz. You’d have to preen and treat your hair, or failing that, pluck them, and she’s not doing that. So she’s new to town, or slovenly. Anyone else?”

Radio glanced back at the pile they’d accumulated so far, his [mask ](https://i.imgur.com/DgirSSv.jpg)making a (“-- \_\_ – “) expression, Vaughn noting his head drooping slightly. Vaughn pointed back at the image on the desk, trying to force Radio to focus.

“Bring an eye to your detailing- we’ve got a woman here, alone, unmarried. That’s a start, but until five o’clock hits, we’ve got nothing else to do but gather candidates. Besides, there’s the off chance she might be a lesbian or drove to work. We’ll need several backup options.”

“Uh… she…”

“No, now you’re just looking for additional reasons to say she’s the one we’re going with, just so you can mark the job as ‘done.’ Focus on getting it done *right*. Stop hyper-fixating on this one in particular, we need several candidates.”

Radio didn’t take his eyes off. “I think she’s our best candidate.”

“Why?”

“Just is.”

Vaughn sighed, channeling his idea of what Emperor might say, rather than the instinct to slap Radio upside his helmeted head. “I need you to explain it to me. Go on, take another look at her- observe her body language in the photo, the clothing. We looked for smile lines- and agreed we don’t see any, right? Note the drab colors, the lack of self-confidence in her posture. So all that stuff we already talked about aside, tell me, *why* are you fixated on her as your leading candidate?” Vaughn fought down the urge to rhetorically ask whether Radio had a habit for picking women he couldn’t talk to.

Vaughn gave Radio a minute for him to absorb how to observe people and make educated judgment calls, something most people were shockingly incapable of. Radio, to what credit he might be given, studied the photograph of the woman who Vaughn had snapped photos of as she had come out of the office. “She’s…well, kind of fat. Soft, you know? Like she never had muscle, never was fit. She’s wearing layers and baggy clothing to hide her body type, even though it’s hot out. Not my type- not really anyone’s, I think. I like ‘em pale and sporty-”

“-and ginger, I know, you poor bastard.” At Radio’s light-up helmet generating a frowny face, a feature Vaughn detested, he just barely managed to restrain himself from delivering a follow-up emotional body blow to his classmate’s self-esteem. “So she either drives drunk from the bar, or gets box wine to drink at home with those awful Data-Flix. Probably the latter, look at the handbag.”

Radio squinted, the helmet’s ASCII representation exaggerating the expression of its wearer to a supposedly-comical extent. “That’s not a real luxury purse. It’s one of those knock-offs. The stitching and patterning is wrong- the angle’s supposed to be ninety degrees the other way, and the colors are inverted.”

“Could you be less of a man?” Vaughn pointed out, paused, then considered the value of the observation as Radio ineffectually defended his honor. “It’s- I mean my mom’s-”

“I suppose that means she does have some money to burn, then, or rather, she’s burning it elsewhere- savings are at zero, and there’s no point saving up dollars in the economy. So either she’s got the world’s dumbest financial advice. It sure isn’t a gym membership and personal trainer, beauty products, or fancy outfits. Maybe a luxury apartment, along the waterfront?” Vaughn ventured. 

Radio shook his head. “Not with those shoes.”

Rather than teasing, Vaughn considered the answer. “Explain.”

“That’s one of those ‘in-between, last-mile’ places. Too far to walk to without sore feet in those cheap knockoff shoes with no padding in the heels, way too short for the city to justify any kind of transit between Something Else Square and there.” He flipped the page. “No band aids on the back of her heels, and I’d like to see her bike in them.” 

“So?”

“So either she’s got callouses thicker than this stack of papers, or she isn’t walking all the way there and back.”

“A car, then? Does she drive drunk, or drive to the liquor store?”

“To drive a mile or so?” Radio shrugged. “Maybe, but in rush hour? Now that the suburbs are emptied out, traffic in the city’s impossible.” Some people were emotionally attached to their cars and sat in them in miserable traffic, no distractions allowed, no matter how much longer it took to get to their destination. “Maybe if she leaves later, just to dodge peak traffic?”

Vaughn considered if the woman might stay late at the office. It would explain a bit, but… “She was a few minutes late getting back from lunch, taking the extra time away from her desk. She probably isn’t the hardest worker- which also means we’ve got a disaffected employee.” This was shaping up to be promising.

“Are there any bars between the office and apartments, something she could split her walk? If she sits for a while, I bet even those heels seem manageable.”

Vaughn paused, considering all their rationales. Were they taking a reach? Absolutely. But still, the logic held. “Alright. That’s a fair number of reasons for why she’s candidate number one. Write those down, then look through the candidates again. You know what we’re after, now?”

“Insecurity,” his unlikely partner agreed, looking up from the stack of images Vaughn had collected around Something Else Square, and missing Vaughn’s frown turning into a scowl at the effort he’d wasted on the person he’d been partnered with- only for him to surprise Vaughn with his next words. “Pedestrian, someone we can track. Yeah. The target you wanted to hit- he’s good, but who do you even see? I mean, I won’t lie. Someone comes up to me, I’ve got my guard up immediately. But if we aim for someone like my candidate- I think we should refocus, and think of who we’ve got to use on them.”

“Speaking of, when is everyone coming back?” Vaughn stared around the skeleton of the old warehouse. It seemed hollowed out without many of its belongings in place.

“They didn’t exactly leave a timetable,” Radio said, pushing and pulling on his helmet to get the lining to scratch his scalp for him. “Things were pretty open-ended. What’s your panic on this sudden last-minute op?”

Vaughn glanced at the papers on the wall, and began scribbling down more notes. “I need to find out what’s happening in there,” he said lowly. “What their job is. What brought these strangers to our city, and what is happening inside.”

“But…why?”

“Because I have a feeling that the bait isn’t just ‘hey, look at this offensive statue, don’t you want to blow it up?’”

“You think it’s where they’re doing the ‘mind wipe’ stuff?” Radio practically whispered.

“No, the timing doesn’t line up, these guys just got here,” Vaughn answered. “Besides, I convinced a guy to start some trouble to test their sensors. He got nabbed tagging and got dragged in.

“What’d they do to him?”

“Probably nothing, he popped back out of the building just as I was leaving. Seemed normal, if a bit spooked. They probably just read him the riot act, gave him a fine, and let him walk.”

“You didn’t *ask*?”

“I wanted to ask him questions, but I worried he’d rat me out to the shil’ as the one who gave him the idea. If I’d had a second person with me…” Vaughn grunted. “Can’t count on convincing someone else, and I don’t want our operatives getting nabbed and interrogated just to investigate a place.” He sucked in a breath, then came to his decision. “I’m gonna pay a homeless guy to piss in the fountain next, then when they nab and release him, ask him what’s in there. Gonna give him a bump out of Sam’s supply as pay.”

“You know he hates your guts, right?”

“I don’t terribly care what Sam thinks of me,” Vaughn waved a hand dismissively. “Frankly, he’s charging us too much, and I see it as getting some of our money’s worth. Better than cash to a junkie.” Vaughn went over to the locker, to see that the stuff had been moved out already. “Where’s the fucking fentanyl?”

“I think he’s moved his stash.”

Vaughn sighed, and went over to the weapons locker, selecting a short, concealable knife. “Plan B, then.”

The gate swung open, and Vaughn excused himself from Radio’s half-uttered question, listening to the heavy *chuff* of the half-tuned, rough running truck engines Larry managed to keep limping along trundled in.

Grouper hopped out first, his stereotypically frightful mask gazing into the warehouse as he pushed along an alien crate, the passenger jumping out and helping mark them with sharpies: *Miskatonic, exterior armor plating*.

“It went well, then?” Radio sprang up from his seat, clearly more excited to get his hands on alien tech and to hear how the fighting went than to continue digging into questions Vaughn didn’t want to give him answers to.

“Went like shit, but we got everything. Alien corpses, to boot. Ring up Miskatonic, tell ‘em we got a whole lot of shit headed their way. A meeting here’s set as soon as Emps gets here.” Grouper responded, hollow voice echoing in the mostly empty warehouse. But Vaughn wasn’t looking at his mask anymore. He was taking in the man’s measurements, his proportions.

“What?”

“Radio, take him. Go with your target. Find out what’s really going on there. You heard Verns’s debriefing, give it to Grouper.  I’ve got a feeling I know what’s going on. Have him meet either me, Verns, or you at Camp Death.”

“But- how will I- I’m not any good at this part!” Radio protested.

“What about the meeting?” Grouper also objected.

“Radio, rely on those instincts,” Vaughn advised. “Seriously, it’s not that hard. Start using them to do more than gawk at them,” Before Radio could ask what he meant by that, Grouper had sensed the urgency in Vaughn’s tone and slapped Radio on the back. “Alright tech wiz, you’ve gotta explain this plan to me, *real* slowly.”

#### After Action Report

I hopped out of Larry’s van, pushing along the crate of rifles in its floating pod and enjoying the way it seemed to drift along effortlessly, Larry handling one of the larger cargo pods we’d lifted a mutineer’s corpse into for Miskatonic to study, my gloves glowing slightly in the shaded warehouse from their strangely bioluminescent blood after having helped lift the corpse.

It was good we’d emptied out most the goods we’d been storing here, giving us plenty of space for everything we’d taken- some of it cargo, some of it the very outfits the Nighkru had been wearing. I took a quick stock, got a quick after-action report, that no one had responded to the gunfire, the railguns, and how stripping the alien ship of non-necessities was going. As the last briefing hit my ears, I glanced around at all the rest of the insurgents milling about, knowing I’d need to address them, feeling the stares. I let go of the pod and jumped up onto the small concrete pad that had once housed some piece of long-gone heavy machinery, my new boots finding easy purchase and months of training making the leap feel easy and natural. I raised my hands, showing off how they glowed as I addressed the room.

“Today didn’t go quite the way any of us had expected,” I began. “Let’s examine what went well. For starters, the railguns and their crews performed well. That’s good work. *Damn* good work, even, to get those shots off in that kind of chaos, and it was absolutely an equalizer in a situation we needed one. Without it, I’m not sure the loyalists would have tried helping us.” This was the first time one hadn’t slagged itself after just a couple shots, too. “Hell, I won’t mince words. We fought aliens, and we came out alive with the same number of people we went in with, I’d call that a win!” A slight cheer went up. “As you know, this base will be abandoned in short order over it being potentially compromised. We’re considering new possibilities for a distribution center. We’re taking suggestions, please contact ‘Jules’ when you see him-” I waved to where the gas-masked man stood with his son, ‘G-Man’ George. “Then head out in twos and threes, you know the drill. Report if you’re being followed via the regular channels.” 

Camp Death’s wouldn’t work for a replacement, the two served very different purposes. Warehouse Base was exposed and inherently vulnerable, yet centrally located and easy to move things to and from there efficiently. Camp Death on the other hand was getting *less* accessible as adjacent neighborhoods were leveled and their roads backed up to the growing woods were ripped up.

We’d need another place like Warehouse Base, and soon.

The central cabin at Camp Death was still under construction, and it had been meant to be my headquarters, not house prisoners.

I’d made sure to learn from my lessons and leave a few volunteers as their wardens operating in shifts in the meantime, dead man’s switches and remote signals to indicate any kind of trouble. While I disliked all my eggs being in one place while leaving the nest, it wasn’t like I could ask Miskatonic to babysit them while we found a new good distribution center for our pilfered goodies. At least, not if I expected to come back and find them in the same condition I’d left them in.

We’d be leaving behind ten soldiers, landmines over the cells, too, and emergency detonators. I’d learned from my past mistakes, and would be prepared for the potentiality of a strike- and at least this way the wardens could try bartering for their own clemency, should things spiral into a hostage situation. I didn’t *like* leaving things in a dangerous situation, but barring the two noblewomen we’d taken to Camp Death to hold in the cabins, we didn’t have many other options, and I felt even worse about potentially leaving them high and dry, facing a strike team with ineffectual rifles or railguns that needed time to charge before firing.

I glanced at the formations filing out, noticing that it was slightly smaller, despite my words of ‘the same number of people as we went in,’ and the somewhat muted response I’d gotten. I ran up to Binary, who held the DSLR camera I’d deployed Vaughn with this morning.

“Where’s Grouper?”

He was one of the few I could trust to maintain discipline no matter the situation, and was supposed to be lead sentry. The man was bloodthirsty and merciless, too, but also trustworthy in carrying out my orders.

“He borrowed about ten men and Radio, and went to the monument,” Binary said. “Vendetta’s not here, either. They weren’t sure when you’d arrive, and said it was urgent.”

“Did they take weapons?” My heart jumped into my throat, worried that he’d taken the alien rifles to try and do the mission of destroying the square for me.

“I don’t think so,” Binary said, checking a crate. “Yeah, the rifles are still here.”

I took a calming breath, feeling my heart rate slow back down to normal.

“Alright,” I said, clearing my mind, and noticing how the inner circle was forming around me once more. “Let’s head to Camp Death. Verns and some of the others are already there waiting for us. Meet there in a couple hours.” Best we got used to meeting there for a while, at least until we had a new Warehouse Base sorted.

* the ""Associate Data Engineer"" section from Manulife seems unwieldy, even though it has the most relevant data-engineer-type stuff in it

Why I was there for only four months:  


 I felt that their demands were unrealistic; they're very new to the world of data, and they wanted a fully automated salesforce ETL pipeline in a month, scripted entirely with python and MySQL. I was the only data engineer in the org, and I had no team and no one to consult with or bounce ideas off of. When I did my job interview with the supervisor, I told him that I didn't have any practice with python programming in my last job, so he should have known that I wouldn't be able to whip out code like a pro. The only other python guy there was too busy and my manager told me not to bother him. I was only with them for four months.  


On my last 1:1 my manager gave me a 4/5 and my resume shows that I've received promotions at other jobs in the past.

27,2,zn1vhc,weclouddata,Best DE Bootcamp based on my experience and objectives?,dataengineering,StrikeSaber47,2022-12-15 19:57,3,"Hey, I know I am one of those people that had to create another DE bootcamp thread but I would love to get some advice on which DE bootcamp that would suit me the best for my next steps in my career.

I am currently working full time as a Business Analysis Manager at a Fortune 500 tech company in the Bay Area for the last five years. In this role, I have been acting as a Swiss Army Knife of sorts being a half-PM and a half-DA specializing in developing data quality, integration, and automation solutions that I then pass onto a BI or a DS team to actually develop in production for us. Most of the data is related to sales and is often anchored by our CRM (SFDC) and with no-code intermediate solutions (such as LeanData or SFDC Flows). From time to time, I do prototype out custom scripts that could be used to fulfill some functionality (like connecting to Snowflake and SAP), but ultimately the ETL solutions I draft are pushed to actual DE's and Dev's to fully build out. I also maintain reports and dashboards on our data health and do the typical update meetings to our stakeholders.

However in the past half a year, I have been wanting to go more towards the path of being a pure BI Analyst, AE, or DE. I have SQL and Tableau knowledge (as I still have to do analysis and prototyping) and some Python knowledge, but not enough to be a reliable scripter. Furthermore, I have no hands-on knowledge of deeper things like Data Lakehouses or Data Orchestration as my job does not require me to use those directly (again we got DE's and Dev's for that). Therefore, I am considering a bootcamp to help fill those gaps and hopefully get me caught up on the technical stack of my skills and sharp enough to pass technical interviews for future BI roles.

Currently, I am looking at three in particular, but each of them has a different approach to how they teach:

1. Jigsaw Labs
2. Data Engineering Camp
3. WeCloudData

Jigsaw Labs: 

A six month course that teaches 'Data Engineering' from a SWE perspective of knowing how to write efficient and well designed Python and SQL code to properly do large-scale ETL processes and only in the second half of the course to focus on Cloud Computing (AWS) and Data Pipelines using Airflow, Fivetran and DBT. According to some of my friends in the DE and Data Infra space that this course is the most useful as the key to being a solid BI/AE/DE is knowing how to write effective Python code and SQL queries that follows a good data design and everything from there should come naturally.

This course is also the most expensive of the three and also includes an externship that you can work with an actual company or non-profit to apply the taught skills to build a real-world applied project and gives an additional nine months of post-course support, especially in sharpening your Python/SQL LC practice for those interviews.

However, the course does not cover anything with Data Lakehouses or Data Streaming, I feel like the most you will be out of the course is a solid BI Analyst, but you will still need to cover the gaps of the rest on your own, which makes me question how much worth I will be for my career switch in the future to like an AE.

Data Engineering Camp:

They have been touted pretty well in this subreddit and the course founder is pretty active on this subreddit as well. His course is the shortest of the three and he seems to cover all of the key bits in the DE toolbox and expectations including Lakehouses (Spark, Databricks) and Streaming (Kafka). However, I am not sure all of this coverage would make me come out of it effective enough to be taken seriously for a career change without further supplementation. It sounds it is great if I wanted to be like a TPM that would work more with an AE/DE team though.

Also from a instruction POV, I will have to take classes between 2AM to 5AM since I am in the West Coast US and they are being taught from Australia.

WeCloudData:

This one seems to be in the middle of Jigsaw Labs and DEC. It is six months and seems to cover all of the basis that Jigsaw and DEC is doing, but not in the detail on the Python/SQL front like Jigsaw. Therefore, I feel like this one will get me the good grasp of what I need to know as an AE/DE, but I am leery if it still lacks the best approach to give me the core foundations needed for my Python/SQL chops. They also provide six months of mentorship and career prep after the course but not externship if you do the part-time program.

Therefore, I am torn if I trade off the philosophy of Jigsaw Labs to teach you the true fundamentals but at the expense of learning the higher-level tools/processes that is also needed, or do a more comprehensive curriculum like DEC or WeCloudData coming from my own experience and aspirations.

Any suggestions is appreciated as I want to do the best bootcamp that would yield me the best foot forward for my next career move. I know a good number of you would tell me to don't bother with any of them and just self-learn (cheaper), but trust me, I learn the best by being instructed, especially if I want to be taught the foundations correctly.

Thx!"

I've been looking into different data engineering bootcamps that are suited for the Eastern Time Zone and that will begin in the next few weeks / few months as I am currently living in Ontario, Canada. I am currently unemployed and can afford to pay most of these tuition fees. For context, I used to work in operations and had technical roles (non software) in Oil and Gas.

My goal is to land a job in data engineering. 

So the content of the bootcamp is important, and having access to either internships or access to recruiters (through the bootcamp itself or to be provided by the instructors / network of people giving the course) plays a major role in me selecting the right bootcamp to increase my chances of landing a job in Ontario, Canada.

I have found the below bootcamps and would appreciate any and all feedback from someone that has taken any of these bootcamps, know someone that has gone through theses bootcamps and landed a job afterwards, or any other bootcamp recommendations.

I’m considering a data engineering program that’s about six months in length part-time. I currently work as a statistical programmer/analyst at a pharmaceutical company. 

I just accepted a new job as a manager of programming, but this is during a time where I am very much interested in diversifying my skill set, so that in the future, I will not be limited to working in the same industries.

I work in regulated environments (sensitive data) that do utilize different technologies and languages, but their use is generally limited compared to non or less regulated spaces. 

I know that data engineering is an evolving field. So my question is:

If I decided to complete the data engineering program now, do you think the skills learned during the process would be obsolete by the time I decide to switch over to engineering?

I originally planned to completely switch careers last year, but I was presented with this opportunity within the same industry. So, I am willing to work this position for a while. But in the meantime, I want to advance my technical skills. 

I’m not short on cash; the program is $6,120. 

Do you think it is worth it? Or should I just forget training until I decide to make the move?"

I've been looking into the possibility of getting into a career in Big Data but am not sure how to proceed. I was outsourced out of my previous job - NAS data storage - and was having no luck finding a job in that field. I heard about Big Data and was intrigued but I'm starting to wonder if it's doable without a university degree.

I took a Big Data Developer course from Simplilearn and I think I kind of got burned. They did an ok job of teaching the basics and the overall concepts but I still don't know what I feel I need to know about processing and sorting data, whether through Hadoop or Spark. My only programming background is being halfway through a book on Python and I feel like if I'm going to get anywhere with Spark/Hadoop I would need something that's very ""this command does this"", hands-on kind of training.

To begin with, the quality of instruction was subpar at best. Many of the teachers were incompetent, unhinged, or simply unqualified to be teaching a coding course. Even worse, our career coach was clueless about the tech industry, having never worked in tech himself. His advice consisted of little more than sharing news articles from major outlets.

The program promised to help us get a job by the end of the cohort, but in reality, we were left to fend for ourselves when it came to building our portfolios and improving our resumes. We were given little guidance and support in these areas, and were expected to figure it all out on our own.

Furthermore, the curriculum itself was inadequate. We barely scratched the surface of React, and by the end of the program, many students still had no idea what a React component was. It was clear that some students should not have been admitted to the program in the first place, as they struggled with even the most basic coding challenges.

To make matters worse, the bootcamp seemed to have no quality control when it came to admissions. They accepted anyone who applied, even if they didn't pass the entrance exam or didn't complete it at all. As a result, the cohort was filled with students who were clearly unprepared and unable to keep up with the coursework. This not only set us back on schedule, but also disrupted the learning experience for those of us who were actually committed to the program.

In short, my experience with General Assembly was a huge waste of money and time. My time at the bootcamp was only stressful, and now at my own leisure I have learned far more on my own after the cohort ended than I did during the program. 

I would advise anyone considering this bootcamp to look elsewhere for a more worthwhile educational experience."
49,1,zzdfto,General Assembly,Counterpoint: My (Positive) Experience as a General Assembly Graduate!,codingbootcamp,hypnofedX,2022-12-30 17:25:16,6,"As a fairly recent (Summer 2021) graduate of General Assembly's SEI program, and a person who read [this other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/zz41nh/my_experience_as_a_general_assembly_graduate/), I'd like to share my extremely positive experience with the program. I'm also still active in GA's alumni programs and Slack channels, and involved as a mentor, so I'm generally familiar with the company as it is now.

To begin with, you should realize your experience is going to be to a large extent dependent on the instructors you get.  GA doesn't hand instructors a curriculum to teach; that would largely defeat the purpose of hiring instructors at all.  In that case, save students $$ and just do a self-guided program with learning modules.  GA wants instructors to develop their own materials following broad guidelines and instructors are generally free to implement lessons as they see fit.

My instructors were phenomenal and only work at GA because they love what they do.  I know this for a fact because I've offered two of them jobs working for me at substantial pay increases over what they earn now and have been turned down.  Both of them were GA grads as well.  I realize everyone says that's a tactic used by bootcamp to pad their job placement stats, but anyone who thinks that isn't doing much math on how little 1-2 hires per 50-60 grads would actually move the dial.

No one promised me a job by the end of the cohort and I'd have been quite suspicious if they did.  On the contrary, quite a few people prepared me for a hiring landscape which is extremely difficult for new devs and would require a lot of work on my portfolio, networking, and person branding to get a job. One of the main draws of GA was that it promised access to a strong alumni network (accurate) and a jobs channel on Slack (had 2-3 jobs/day posted when I graduated). I've gotten interviews through it and know a few people hired through it as well. I also appreciated that GA has you working with Outcomes starting in Week 1 whereas a lot of programs seem to defer that stuff until after graduation.  As busy as the cohort was, I felt much more prepared for the job market the day I graduated and very much liked having the outcomes stuff in mind as I progressed through the program.

Incidentally, if someone manages to get through a few weeks of React, they should know what a component is.  Criticising a React course because its students don't know what a component is would be similar to criticising a English course because some students graduate without learning what a sentence is. The nature of the complaint makes more sense if you assume the shortcoming to be that of the learner reaching their own ceiling rather than a failing of the instructor(s).

The commentary from the other referenced post about admissions standards being low is the one part which is consistent with my own experience.  Remember that General Assembly, like almost every other bootcamp, is a for-profit operation. Money is green whether it's coming from the pocket of Alan Turing or a from that of a moron. That said, I also don't think it's functionally a problem. My experience was neither tainted nor diminished by the fact that a lot of students aren't cut out for this work.  The vast majority dropped out in the first few weeks anyway.

I'd also like to add that I connected with most my cohort mates on social media in the first few days of the program and quite a few newer students since then.  I've seen a number of people post ""warnings"" similar to the one posted by u/kmachappy. In every case where I was also able to trace that user back to one of GA's channels which is closed to the public, it turned out to be someone I already had the impression to want the world handed to them on a platter or simply isn't cut out for dev work and is lashing out for the purpose of faulting someone else for their own shortcomings. I can't comment specifically on this case because I'm not sure who that user is or what GA channels they were active in.

If the other post is dissuading you from General Assembly, ignore its advice to look at other bootcamps.  GA does have some shortcomings but most of them stem from rapid growth and challenges properly scaling their operation to match.  Read this subreddit for a while and you'll find that all bootcamps are having similar challenges and you won't escape them by going to a different program.

To be clear, I don't work for General Assembly nor do I think the program is necessarily better than any of the other major bootcamps. I just felt the other post is getting enough attention that I felt it deserved pushback."

I have narrowed down my choices to general assembly, rithym, and have two admissions phone call questionnaire meetings in the next couple days with tech elevator, and code Smith. What are everyone's thoughts in terms of updating my search and narrowing my choices down to those four or so. I don't believe I stated it last time but I have a master's degree in social work a bachelor's in art and I'm currently a teacher at a community college doing art so I have a pretty good resume and work ethic as well as I'm a member of a local 638 construction union plumbing and steam fitting group in New York City. I feel that despite not having any experience in coding but having a passion for computers it seems that general assembly is my best bet so far as it teaches python HTML Java c++ and c sharp.

51,3,zc096p,General Assembly,Considering attending General Assembly or Ironhack,codingbootcamp,Hurugilliant,2022-12-03 23:22:03,10,"Hello u/codingbootcamp!

&#x200B;

This is my first post in this subreddit but I have been a long time lurker.  I've recently graduated (July 2022) with my BS degree in software engineering from a C tier college. I had a short internship (16 weeks) back at the end of 2020 when I finished my AS in computer programming and thought that would help me out landing job interviews.  

&#x200B;

After 4-5 months of no success I began considering coding bootcamps as a way to improve my skills but more importantly the networking. See I am having a hard time networking and landing interviews due to me being a complete novice at this. Especially since my Github page is rather lacking and the material that was taught to me was outdated to say the least. 

&#x200B;

So all in all I am committed to doing a coding bootcamp and wanted to get some feedback on what everyone thinks? What bootcamps are the best at networking and or getting you interviews?"

Basically paid 16k for an instructor to read through powerpoint slides for 3 months. Apart from it, the Instructional Assosciates who were supposed to support you had only surface level UX knowledge and would go blank if you were to ask anything that was a little advanced. The entire program they kept on prioritizing the fact that networking is the key to landing a job. I completely get that networking is key to anything but had they even put 10-20% of that effort in teaching the class, students would be more knowledgable in UX. Also, the client project that was supposed to be the highlight of the program is probably the biggest scam of all. Students were divided into a group of 4-5 and were basically given a client who had no business and no employee in their company and was a self-run side project. One of the client that one of the group in my co-hort received was a business that had 0 customers, 0 employees and had no idea of even what a UX actually is. Like seriously. Apart from it, they sell this dream of how everyone can be a UX designer and preety much accept anyone and everyone in the class. So basically, you could even have no idea of what Figma is and you would get accepted in the class. The problem with that is whenever you are doing group projects, they strategically divide people in such a way that people with really good figma and UX skills would be paired with someone who has no idea or clue of anything at all and that would benefit the students who worked their ass off. This might sound really harsh to people I went to the program but I just want to lay it out there for other people like me who are thinking of joining the bootcamp. I am very positive that More than 75% of my fellow colleagues were dissatisfied with the UXDI program but they were just too afraid to voice their opinions. To anyone who are thinking of joining General Assembly, stay away from it. I honestly learned more in my 2 month of self-learning UX than wasiting my time in GA."

I'm interested in taking a full-time Web Development bootcamp in Toronto this Summer and have been researching into these two schools.

I have a coding background and I worked as a web developer for 2 years but I have a 3 year gap in my career and I feel the need to refresh knowledge. I truly want to go back to development. I have been trying to do this in my free time but with my full-time job I end up exhausted and I don't feel like I am progressing.

Also, I came to Canada a couple years ago and I have no connections whatsoever, so I think the networking side of it could be beneficial for me.

I want a bootcamp that will challenge me as much as possible. So I'd be curious to hear your  experience if you have been to any of these two schools and what you think would be the best fit for me given my background.

Also, since COVID started, I wanted to know if this has affected people's experience taking the bootcamp online and finding a job afterwards.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I decided to go with LHL since from the very beginning the process with Brainstation has little things that I did not like, including the fact that they offer career services only for 6 months after graduation. I start in August ! 

EDIT 2: I went to LHL. Finished the course last November 2021 and found a job in 2 weeks. My experience at LHL was very good, it was the refresher I needed and I learned a lot of basic things that I never learned before which was wonderful. 
I was worried because the course was all online and I thought I'd miss out on opportunities to network, etc. But actually doing it online was better. You do spend 10+ hours a day as they say doing the daily work and assignments, so to me not commuting and eating at home was a plus.
The instructors are amazing and super friendly. I was pleasantly surprised with career servinces' support while looking for jobs, I ended up landing a job via LinkedIn but I got a job offer from a LHL contact as well. 
A lot of my classmates without experience as developers found jobs very quickly.
Best decision ever ! I hope this helps.

Thank you!"

A little background about me, I went to uni for Electrical Engineering and have worked as a Project Engineer and Design Engineer since graduating in 2017. For the past few months I've been self-teaching Python and AI (HarvardX AI cert on EdX and a few others), but have been looking to branch towards Full-Stack. I know most bootcamps won't necessarily guarantee to make you a Full Stack developer as it all depends on you get what you put into it.

Brainstation covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MySQL (mostly focused on the front end though)

General Assembly covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MongoDB/Python/Django/PostgresSQL and very briefly covers data structs and algos, but the latter is something I can look into more myself.

I'm just wondering everyone's experience and if they find one was more useful than the other and any other information you can share.

Thanks!!"

I'm interested in taking a full-time Web Development bootcamp in Vancouver this January and have been researching heavily into these 2 schools.

As a bit of background, I'm an IT Support Specialist who also has about a year and a half of programming experience after completing Harvard's CS50 and a CS50 final project in my spare time over the past 16 months:

[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)

[https://github.com/bocajbee/CS50-Final-Project](https://github.com/bocajbee/CS50-Final-Project)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqlg177I2tk&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqlg177I2tk&t)

While CS50 and the Web Development track in this course has given me a solid foundation, I'm seeking to go to a bootcamp to further increase my skills and hopefully land a Jr. Web Dev role out the other end.

I have been accepted into both Lighthouse Labs and Brainstation. However I'm still unsure which one to pick. Something I have noticed about Lighthouse is that they have ""Stretch goals"" for people like me going in with a fair bit of programming experience already. I also noticed Lighthouses interview process was a fair bit more rigorous than Brainstation's.

Whatever bootcamp I go to, I absolutely want to be pushed as hard as possible. So I'd be curious to hear your guys experience if you have been to any of these two schools and what you think would be the best fit for me given my background.

Thanks!"

Writing here more for my own sake as kind of a brainstorm, but hope it can give some ideas to others.  I’ve added the brands where applicable, but i’m sure there are others.

 1. Buy a small camera that has no screen or internet connectivity and doesn’t require your phone to upload photos.  Mine is from Opkix and you can wear it as a ring, or mount it on your sunglasses or hat.  It can transfer the files directly to a computer through usb and has no cloud storage aspect.  One less excuse to pull out my phone.

2. Alphasmart 3000.  This is a little keyboard with a shitty screen that you can use to take notes digitally. It has no internet connectivity, and lasts a year or more on 3 AA batteries.  Again you can transfer the notes to your computer through usb.  One more less excuse to pull out my phone, although to be fair this only works when i’m at home because this thing is bulky.  When i’m out i usually do a voice dictation note into my smart watch.

3. Mp3 player that doesn’t allow you to skip or change songs. It only does play and pause, and you can change genres or mood by changing out the sd card that you have pre-loaded with music.  There should be some limit on how many times you can change sd cards per day too. The idea behind this is for it to be similar to using cd players or tape players back in the day.  You didn’t have that nagging constant choice/distraction to change to another song or see what else you have, and besides being less distracting this also let you enjoy the current track more.  I haven’t found such a product yet so i’ll probably make my own at some point.

4. Ksafe aka kitchen safe. Bought one after seeing it in the Social Dilemma.  I can fit my tv remote and phone in it, as well as a key to a lock which i use to lock up my laptops in my backpack.  I try to do this around 8-9pm every day and then i can only read/write/listen to music for the rest of the day.  I’ve done it on sundays a few times too for a tech free day.

5. Old laptop + terminal-based programs. I got an old thinkpad and am learning freebsd.  I prefer freebsd vs linux for this purpose since it’s all one cohesive OS with comprehensive offline documentation.  My user experience with linux involved a lot of googling to figure out how to do something for my specific kernel + distro so that means more internet.  In freebsd everything is either in the man pages, the handbook, or Absolute Freebsd.  This old laptop is user serviceable. Terminal based programs for everything from youtube to email to budgeting to reddit (still at the early stages of learning the OS so this will come later) will allow me to use them without the flashy distracting aspects and will allow me to keep my user experience “dumb”.

Will add more if/when i think of it.  Anyone else do similar things such as the above that can give me more ideas?"

I would say the most exhausting part for me in the beginning was doing user interviews because  I’m kind of introverted but it does get a little easier over time. The anxiety of talking to people slowly goes away. 

At the first class you are told to pick an idea for a final project and then gradually work on it for those 10 weeks and build on it according to the lessons you learn each week. A good thing about the course is that you’ll still have access to the material 6 months later. If anyone is interested I definitely recommend it!

Hi guys, I thought I would like to update you with the coding bootcamps since I keep receiving messages asking questions. After my post I actually had to help out my family financially due to an emergency. So I didn't have the funds to attend the bootcamp as planned. Now it's 2019 and I recently became unemployed again so I am rethinking my options. The bootcamps may work for some people but I changed my perspective since it seems so expensive and I am sort of uncertain about the job prospects of front-end web developer. I am now a bit skeptical whether rushing to learn things in 3 months would really get me far. Right now I am actually considering going to school/college/university maybe part-time or full-time in Data analytics/data science. My background and a little further education in the field might help me change my career into a new direction. Sorry for those who ask me questions about the coding bootcamp whether I did go to one or whether I managed to find a job in the new field, I just didn't go through with it. Hope you will find your answers from someone and sorry that I couldn't be a better help!

[My original post is below]:

Hi Torontonians! I am interested in taking a full-time coding bootcamp in web development in Toronto this summer or this fall and have been researching heavily into these 4 coding schools as well as visiting them in person. I still find it difficult to decide which school to go with as they all have similar prices and quirks. I would like to ask the full-time bootcamp alumni who have experiences with any of these schools in Toronto. Can you get a full-time job with in 3 months of graduation? What type of position/company did you join? If you don't mind me asking, the starting salary as a junior web developer? Did any of you end up starting a start-up? Did you find the school being supportive during your job search/career coaching? Do you keep in touch with other alumni?Howd you fund your coding bootcamp? Any lenders you could recommend? Which school would you recommend me choosing? I'm  a a female looking  to change my career. I'm also new to Canada and I want to make sure I don't go completely broke after the bootcamp because it's all I have. 

Here is what I find on each school in a quick summary:

Hackeryou: 
probably the best reviews I have seen so far among all the coding schools.
Price:$8500 (no payment plan though)
Great network and support from the school and great alumni community.
Program: 9 weeks full-time
Curriculum: seems updated. They added React and removed WordPress and PHP.

Brainstation:
Their office is really nice as they have the entire building. Seems like they host conference and networking events there too.
Price: $10,000 ( I got $2000 off for being a female learning to code) and they have payment plan for over 6 months
Program:10 weeks full time 
Curriculum: it seems they cover both front-end and back-end development, with Node.js and React and other typical materials.
Note: from the reviews I heard that their career support isn't that great. Anyone could comment?

Red Academy:
Founded in Vancouver but the school in Toronto has been here for a year now. It seems to be the fastest growing one, emphasizing on real life projects.
Price: $7500 ($1000 off for career changers) with payment plan
Program:12 weeks full time
Curriculum: seems like they are the only one school that doesn't cover React or Node.js but they cover WordPress, Angular and PHP 

Lighthouse labs:
Good reviews overall but shortest program compared to other schools.
Price:$10,170 with $1,170 deposit. No payment plan it seems.
Program : 8 weeks full-time
Curriculum: Covering node.js and seems pretty updated.

I just want to make sure I make the best investment, both time and money as well as the potential employment opportunities. Please let me know your experiences with these schools!"

Is it possible for me to get a job as a web developer? To begin with, I am almost 54. I have been running a retail business 20 plus years until a couple of years ago. Closed the business due to Covid, and harsh competition (especially online). Since then, I have been studying to have a career change. First, I spent some time to get CompTia A+ certified. Took me several months, and finally got the certification. My plan was Network and Security, but ended up working for a city government dealing with documents and onBase system for several months. Due to a personal emergency, I had to quit. After that, I was learning Data Analytics for two months, Excel, MySql, Power Bi, and etc. Through Coursera, I have gotten Google Analytics Certification, but realized that this is not my field because it requires much of soft skills, even though you need good soft skills in every job. As an immigrant, I thought my English was not good enough. Maybe I am wrong. Now, I have been studying web development for 8 months. HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, TypeScript. As much as I try to learn, there are always so much more to learn. I applied for some positions, but it feels like I am not good enough. I am not a CS major and I do not have any experience working for an actual company, even though I have been building simple websites for myself and post on github. I don't have 3-4 years of experience that they ask for. After getting several email from companies that say they have decided to go with somebody else, I have talked to BrainStation about bootcamps. I was told that around 90% of the graduates find their jobs in less than 6 months or so because they have a great job placement service. It will cost me $16,500 - $2,500(scholarship, maybe). Is it worth? I know that there are so many people laid off from companies and competition should be harsh, besides new college graduates.

Even though I really enjoy learning new things so much, am I just dreaming? Should I find something else or play lottery? Can you tell me the reality? I appreciate your honest advice. You can hurt me with honesty. At least I will still look good. I'm in South Florida by the way."

Of course, the biggest difference is that schools are much longer in length, but from the job postings I've skimmed it seems that certifications are more desired/recognized. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but going off of website descriptions, it seems like the product schools focus on the basics of product management, high-level theories, and experiential learning. It seems like the agile certifications are (of course) specific to their methodology and focus on building tactical/practical skills and knowledge.

Original post below---

I met my psychodynamic therapist, let's call her Emily, in September 2020, through a referral/network service that itself came highly recommended. She had a decade of experience and was considered very good (her rate was at the highest end of what this referral service offered). Based on this, I assumed she was some kind of genius in ways I did not understand, and so I always felt intimidated by her. Due to COVID, our sessions were over zoom, and once restrictions lifted her office felt too far away for a workaholic like me to make the commute, so we never saw each other in person.

I thought she was an effective therapist, worth what I was paying her. She made me feel comfortable enough to get me talking about the shame I felt over having a sexuality, not just because of internalized homophobia (I'm a gay woman), but also because I had gender dysphoria growing up and am thus affected by negative stereotypes about men being sexual predators. Compounding this, in 2017 I was the target of a bad faith and homophobic accusation of sexual harassment (made by someone I had deeply trusted, in retaliation for my blowing the whistle on a startup we were involved in). Those and other experiences gave me C-PTSD. To give you an idea of the extent of it: I once entered a committed, monogamous relationship with someone who was asexual even though I am not asexual because I thought it was shameful to consider sex important in a relationship.

Even though she was the first person to make me feel comfortable enough to talk about my sexual shame, for whatever reason I never thought of her romantically. I think the reason is simply that I believed she was ""too good at her job to think of me that way"" and I had had enough trauma associated with unrequited love that I was more than happy to stay away from situations that had any whiff of turning out that way.

This may be a good time to mention that I'm not a normal client. I'm likely what psychoanalytic writers like Dr. Nancy McWilliams describe as ""schizoid"". Most therapists do not seem to know what that is, and it is extremely different from the definition of ""schizoid personality disorder"" in the DSM-5, which I consider to be moronic and which was presumably written by people who are not schizoid. Dr McWilliams describes the schizoid personality well in the following article from 2005; I recommend that all therapists read this article so that they can spot schizoid clients early and hopefully avoid the mistakes that my therapist and her supervisor made. Pay particular attention to ""the schizoid-hysterical romance"" section on page 18. I did not know about this personality type while I was in treatment with my therapist; if I had, I could have informed her and spared a lot of grief: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7142775\_Some\_Thoughts\_about\_Schizoid\_Dynamics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7142775_Some_Thoughts_about_Schizoid_Dynamics)

Anyway, because this topic of romance was not on my radar, I apparently missed the early warning signs that something may have been developing from her side. So while I wish I could go back and reconstruct what the narrative may have looked like from her perspective, I can't do it reliably. But I can offer my best shot. The earliest case I can point to of getting a peek into her life (she was normally very walled off about her personal details) is a conversation in the summer of 2021 in which she said ""emotions aren't rational!"" and I essentially said ""emotions come from somewhere, therefore they follow a type of logic and you can reason about them"", to which she said ""say there's no reason why you shouldn't be happy, but you're not happy"". I could not connect that example to anything I was experiencing (I had plenty of reasons to be unhappy), so I assumed she had taken an example from either her own life or the life of another client. I said something along the lines of ""just because society can't come up with a reason for why you're unhappy, doesn't mean you don't have a good reason"" and gave the example of someone I knew who would not be happy in the conventional life of marriage/career/kids but rather wanted to go on a road trip across America. I likely also gave her my feminist rant about how people love to portray emotions as illogical as a way to invalidate women, because women are stereotyped as being ""more emotional"" (as if anger is not an emotion). Whatever I said seemed to trigger some type of realization in her. She said something like ""huh - so for you, there's the emotions, but the logic is also right there underneath them"" (in my head, I was like ""duh"").

Now for the comedy part of the story. A weird thing about me as a client is that (probably due to some combination of trauma and high-functioning neurodivergence) I exist in a constant state of hyperfocus, so if I'm not paying attention to something, I am unlikely to notice it. Very late into therapy, I had a session in which I noticed she was wearing what looked like a wedding/engagement ring. I do recall feeling immense disappointment that it looked like a ring that was bought by a person whose self-image is tied to being able to buy expensive things for women. In my mind, I had hoped she was cooler than that. I was still going to ask about the ring out of politeness (offer a congratulations if she had gotten engaged), but then I realized **I wasn't sure how long she had been wearing the ring for.** I got so embarrassed at the idea of revealing to this person who clearly puts a lot of thought into her appearance that I was someone who straight up might not notice if she was wearing a wedding ring (I have been shamed a lot for not noticing things that others notice; it often gets interpreted as uncaring), that I just did not ask. I figured, maybe I'll work up the courage to talk about this in the next session. **But then in the next session she was not wearing the ring!** I went with the most boring explanation I could think of: that she decided not to wear her ring because she did not want to bias how clients thought of her. In hindsight, I think an equally possible explanation is that she had been wearing her ring the whole time (google stalking revealed she was married well before I started seeing her), and through a freak not-quite-coincidence, she decided to stop wearing the ring right after the session in which I noticed the ring for the first time. I wish I could tell you where this session fell with respect to the ""emotions are logical"" session, but I don't remember.

Another session from around this time that I wish I could date, but cannot: she asked me a question about how I felt towards her, and I responded with some version of ""I don't want to come off as clingy"". She seemed confused and so I clarified ""I don't want to fall into the stereotype of a client who becomes overly attached to their therapist"", to which she replied ""the stereotype is that you fall in love with your therapist"". I shrugged (in my head saying ""tomato tomahto""), and she let the topic go with a bit of a smirk. I felt no impetus to clarify that I wasn't in love with her, especially since nothing makes you look like you have feelings for someone more than a suspicious need to clarify that you're not in love with them.

Around August 2021, we had a difficult session where she behaved in a way that triggered a lot of antipathy from me (stuff along the lines of opining on a sensitive topic without properly understanding it). I told her as much when she asked about it (she picked up on it), and we sat in silence while I debated internally about whether to end therapy with her. After some reluctance, she revealed she had an insecurity that caused her to double down when she's afraid she doesn't understand something. She said \~3 times that she was being ""very vulnerable"" with me as she told me this (even though I don't consider it to be a particularly bad flaw? Isn't there an established term for this behavior in social psychology? The ""backfire effect""?). I was happy with her explanation, and we continued therapy. But she said something at the end of the exchange which struck me as odd: ""thanks for not being mean to me"". I can't remember what I said in response, but in my head I was like ""you told me you were being vulnerable like 3 times - what kind of asshole would be mean to you after that?"". Alongside her saying that emotions aren't rational, this seemed like further evidence that she was surrounded by assholes. But again, I didn't really think much about it, since I knew it was ""none of my business"".

Having google-stalked her post ""breakup"", I have pieced together that she had a learning disability (likely dyslexia based on other clues) growing up, and this probably created the phobia of ""not knowing something"" in her. In hindsight, it also means she likely found me intimidating, since I was highly successful along the dimensions she would have struggled with, and many people who are successful in my way tend to be assholes to those who are not. Aside: she loves to work with kids who have learning disabilities - something about this warms my heart. Additional aside: her husband works in an asshole moneymaking profession (same vibe as being a lawyer for big tobacco, won't specify the further since I've been told this post has too many personal details), and I am confused why no one warned her that this was proof he was an asshole.

Fast forward to March 2022, 1.5 years into therapy. My mental health, which had been circling the drain since the traumatic events from 2017, was taking a nosedive (I happened to post about it on rSuidiceWatch with this same account, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rzqqs3/i_cant_get_past_someone_i_lost/)). I was calmly telling Emily about planning to kill myself in 5 years (I likened it to euthanasia as I was tired of living in pain), and asked her to help me plan out those 5 years to make them meaningful (you cannot hospitalize a client unless they express a concrete plan, and I was careful not to do that).

The night that I told my girlfriend-at-the-time about my 5-year plan, I texted Emily to tell her that my girlfriend wasn't taking it well (no shit) and might escalate it by forcing me to go to the hospital. Emily asked for a call, and I agreed. It was the strangest call. I could tell she was holding back something and was struggling to express it. She asked how I felt towards her and I had nothing to say. She emphasized that we had been talking for two hours each week for over a year and still I didn't have anything to say. She said she thought I was minimizing our relationship (she was right; I had an attachment phobia and it was showing). I said I couldn't let myself feel attached to her because I didn't know anything about her. She said ""I feel like you do know a lot about me - and everything that I'm thinking? And feeling?"", with a LOT of emphasis on ""feeling?"". I think on some level I knew then, but it was so deep in my subconscious that my conscious mind just continued to play dumb. I asked her how that could be possible, given that I felt like I didn't know anything about her. She pointed to the time she had been vulnerable, I brushed it off as nothing (""that's 1 insecurity!""). She told me, in reference to my plan to kill myself, that she would miss me. I choked, she caught it and said, with mixed shock and surprise: ""is that hard to hear?"". I told her I didn't want to add another person to the list of people to think about in the context of me ""pressing quit"". We ended the conversation with no resolution and a plan to resume it in therapy. But I did ask her permission to text her thoughts between sessions (in an effort to cultivate more of a connection from my side), and she agreed to receive them.

Our subsequent therapy sessions were a similarly confusing game of cat-and-mouse, with her trying to bring up the topic and me doing a lot of mental gymnastics to put distance between us. A hallmark of dyslexia is taking longer to find the right words. A hallmark of me (I have long suspected that I'm a high-functioning autistic; it's masked well so people don't notice) is a capacity to be overly literal and ignore all hints, particularly when I'm scared. I wanted to continue seeing her as a mentor figure, and I guess in her mind it didn't even occur to her that that was how I saw her because she was so intimidated by me. Comical examples of mental gymnastics from my side include me claiming that she felt ""generationally separated"" from me because she wasn't online much (she's 5 years older than me), and becoming convinced that she had kids (she loves kids but does not appear to have kids of her own, based on the google stalking I did after things ended).

The thing that FINALLY made it click was when, after a particularly exhausting round of cat-and-mouse where I asked her to precisely spell out what she meant by ""I think you're trying to make this into a friendship, but I'm not your friend, I'm your therapist, it's a different kind of relationship"", and she could not, she said something like ""the line between an intense sexual connection and a really strong friendship is razor thin, huh?"" and ""I guess platonic attraction is often mistaken for sexual attraction"". I can't remember her exact wording because my brain was short circuiting as she said this, no longer able to deny the implication. I made some pre-packaged remarks about queer women mistaking friendships with straight men for romantic attraction (she nodded awkwardly), while I bought time to process.

I have read that there's a recognition in psychoanalysis that transference tends to either be mutual OR representative of how other people in the client's life tend to feel about the client. In my case, it was the latter. Regardless of what you think of Emily's professionalism, her revelation did help me piece together other conflicts I had had. In that session, after Emily gave up on trying to get me to talk about how I felt towards her, I told her (in reference to those conflicts, which had been the topic of previous sessions): ""I think I know what I did to hurt them. I aggressively friendzoned them even though I knew there was chemistry"". I had not admitted to being aware of chemistry prior to this point. Emily paraphrased it well, as she often did; she said ""you do that thing of 'haha we're just friends, right?'"", and I said ""yes, exactly"". And then I remarked, ""when you think about it, \[person I had a conflict with\] never said she \*didn't\* have feelings for me"". Emily said, ""no she did not"", and then said again, as if to herself, ""no she did not"". I said ""I just sort of...put that on her"". Then, after a pause, I said ""it's like erasing the unspoken"". Emily said ""that's painful"". I said ""yeah...no wonder they hate me"". I don't remember the rest of the session; maybe it ended soon after.

That evening, I felt overwhelmed. There was an almost painful static in the back of my brain, as though my subconscious was having an argument with itself. I took THC (legal where I am) in an effort to get deeper into my subconscious so I could at least referee the damn argument. I knew intellectually that she had just wanted to help me but I didn't know how to move forward. I had gained comfort from seeing her as a superhuman figure who was always in control of emotion-land, but it was clear she had lost control. I felt as though a parental figure had let me down.

I tried to resolve the conflict by telling myself that her feelings weren't real, that it was just something she did because she thought it was in my best interest. However, that night, I began exhibiting signs of an altered psychological state. Although some might have called it mania, it wasn't ""real"" mania because I was able to sleep (also I have no history of bipolar disorder). I'll grant that it was mania-like in that I was dipping into some kind of euphoric denial. I stayed up the whole night texting Emily pseudo-spiritual insights. I became convinced that dreams were a way to tap into a wider unified consciousness because they are the one time when noise from the physical body quietens down enough for us to sense subtle vibrations from the wider consciousness (such beliefs align with Indian spirituality to a T). I observed that I had a tendency to let my mind ""helicopter parent"" my body, and wrote a comedy routine in which my body gained temporary control of my language center and started complaining about the rest of me. You get the idea.

Our following session, on a Friday, was short because I was sleepy from having stayed up the whole night texting her my philosophy. She told me she was starting to worry that I was manic and wanted a psychiatrist to weigh in. I told her I didn't trust my psychiatrist (who barely knew me) to be able to diagnose me better than she could, and went through the mania checklist with her. She seemed to relax when I clearly wasn't fitting the criteria, particularly when I told her my mind wasn't racing (not unless I invited it to think about something), and that it was for the most part very quiet. Still, we didn't talk about the elephant. Also, I think it was in this session that she realized (in the context of me describing my troubles with social norms as a kid) that I may be autistic (I had thought it was obvious; she made me realize it's not; like many women on the spectrum, I evidently mask it well...too well).

After that session, I decided to text her about the elephant. I told her my prepackaged ""explanation"" that she was just acting and trying to do what she thought was good for me. And also I took the opportunity to finally ask about the damn ring. She just said she was glad I was sharing all this with her and that we would discuss it in our next session.

Unfortunately we did not manage to talk about it. I was hoping she would lead the discussion but she seemed to be out of words too. The closest we got was me asking her if I was correct in my hypothesis that she likes acting, and she just said ""I've never acted in my life"", over and over. Well if she wasn't acting...I was out of excuses to make for her.

That session turned out to be our very last. Between that session and the next scheduled one, I had what I guess is fair to call a psychotic break. It lasted about half an hour and essentially consisted of me waking up from a nap in a weird brainstate, babbling in Hindi about vibrations and the collective consciousness. What I remember thinking is that I was on the threshold between the physical plane and the spirit plane and was allowing my body to be used as a conduit for what the spirits had to say. The whole time, I knew that if I wanted to snap back into the physical plane in order to start ""making sense"" to my very worried girlfriend, I could have, but I wanted to hear what the spirits had to say and the only way to do that was to temporarily give them control of my movements and vocal chords. My girlfriend, fearing I would not remember the incident, took a video of the episode. My mother later watched the video and said that everything I was saying was making sense from an Indian cultural context (that was also my opinion). Put differently, Indians would legitimately view it as a person having a spiritual experience. My girlfriend at the time also offered the explanation that I was experiencing a ""rapid reintegration of suppressed personality traits"", which I like.

But my therapist didn't get to speak to my mother, and she insisted that I get a medical evaluation. I begrudgingly agreed when I became concerned she would force the matter, but warned her that I would hate her for it. I went to a top-ranked hospital, and I kid you not, all they could diagnose me with was ""Mood Change"". I think they wanted to tack on hypomania, but the fact that I fell fast asleep during my ER stay (the whole visit took a solid 9 hours before they discharged me) maybe threw a wrench in that.

After that forced ER visit, I was on a cultural high horse and overplayed my hand. I canceled my next session and told Emily over text that she was unfit to be my therapist because of the ""stunt"" she pulled by making me go to the ER even though my family thought I was fine. I (""graciously"" in my head) told her that I was still open to staying in contact. She tried to defend herself, and in the process of explaining why I believed she was ""unfit"" to be my therapist I made the mistake of talking about my psychotic break and how ""you Westerners"" would pathologize that even though from an Indian cultural context I was making sense. I got back an oddly formal text in which she said ""I can only see you today, and ongoing, if you are in the care of a psychiatrist who will coordinate care with me"". I interpreted ""coordinate care"" as ""agree with me that something is wrong with you"", and replied with ""Fuck you. We're done."" She said ""I'm interpreting that as the end of our work together. I hope you find peace"". I said no shit, and called her a psychological rapist (for forcing the belief that there was something wrong with me when I was in fact fine).

I regretted it very quickly.

I apologized within half a day, but it was far too late. She asked me to stop contacting her. I knew about the existence of supervisors but thought of them more as consultants, not as people who had the power to intervene in high-stakes decisions. Also, I think she is very attached to her supervisor (she had said something once in a session about how she trusted her supervisor completely because her supervisor was open to ""alternative approaches"", which makes me think her gamble to bring up the erotic transference was endorsed by her supervisor, and thus her supervisor had a vested interest in portraying me as unstable when things did not go as planned). Had I known all this, I would have calculated my moves very differently. I think her supervisor told her to cut off contact entirely, because even when my life took a really bad turn and I begged Emily to take me back as a client, she did not respond (granted, I made it sound like I was not a risk to myself, but only because I didn't want to force her to work with me; I wasn't thinking about what was needed to force her supervisor to let her speak to me).

I haven't had much luck with therapists since. The less skilled ones behave in ways that make me question their aptitude and professionalism, especially when I compare them to what Emily was like. The skilled ones tell me they feel out of their depth and that I should be in an intensive program, but I've already been through one of those. Those programs are not designed for people whose emotional regulation mechanisms are primarily intellectual rather than physiological in nature. Seriously, most of my emotions begin as sensations in my brain, not as sensations in my body, and they only reach my body when I lose mental control of them. At some point I just gave up on looking for a therapist, because I couldn't take the pain of being reminded that no one seems to know what to do with me. Even the DSM-5 doesn't get the definition of schizoids correct. Plus, the way things ended with Emily was horrible, and I don't want to risk going through that again.

I really think the whole thing could have been salvaged if Emily and I had just had the time to work through it. But because of what looks like a self-serving call by a scared and culturally ignorant supervisor, it became a nightmare.

Anyway. Thanks for reading."

Every business needs software developers to create applications that solve problems and improve efficiency. But with so many different developers available with diverse skill sets, it can be hard to know which one is the best fit for your business. In this blog, we will introduce you to Java developers and their roles and responsibilities and also [how Synergent can help you find the right developer for your business](https://synergent.net/).

# What is java?

Java is a programming language used to create software that is compatible with a wide range of operating systems. It is a two-stage programming language, which means it can be compiled and interpreted. It differs from most [other compiled languages](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-compiled-language) because it does not compile directly to an executable file.

The code in Java is first compiled and then translated into a binary format known as Java Byte Code. Finally, the JBC is compiled and interpreted so that it may run in the target operating environment. This contrasting behavior is a big benefit for developers since it means they can write code once and run it anywhere.

# What is the role of a Java developer?

Like other high-level programming languages, Java developers are responsible for various tasks throughout[ the development lifecycle of applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/overview-alm), from concept and design to testing.

* Phases of java program design, implementation, and upkeep.
* Participate in software and architectural development projects.
* Analyze, program, test, and debug software.
* Identifying production and non-production application issues.
* Converting demands into stipulations.
* Create, test, deploy, and maintain application software.
* Provide changes to improve existing Java application processes.
* Create technical blueprints for application development.
* Develop Java application code

Java is everywhere, from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, and cell phones to the Internet. Java is used in the tech stacks of companies such as Uber, Pinterest, Google, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, and Airbnb, demonstrating Java’s ubiquity and efficacy. Although Java’s popularity has begun to wane in recent years, the fact that major corporations continue to use it attests to its dependability and solid support. As a result, the programming language has always had strong positions in both industrial programming and the enterprise segment.

# What is Java used for?

# Mobile Application Development

Since the invention of smartphones, [mobile application development has increased rapidly](https://www.openxcell.com/mobile-app-development/). Millions of mobile applications are now available through the three most prominent smartphone app stores.

Java is ideal for developing complicated applications with multiple interfaces because of its nature. It also works well as a programming language for mobile applications because it is great for linking diverse devices.

# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is a sort of software that is designed to perform complicated automatic computations. AI software is used in a variety of businesses, including credit companies, banking, Amazon’s Echo, and other smart gadgets, to mention a few.

# Big Data

Big data is an industry that tracks and reports data for a variety of purposes. Many businesses utilize data analytics to track users, contacts, products, sales, and other metrics. Java also makes it simple to develop visuals to represent this data in an understandable and digestible manner.

Because of the utility of this benefit, it is an ideal choice for big data because it simplifies the process of working with massive volumes of data.

# Software Development

According to the WORA philosophy, Java is a great choice for developing software since it is flexible enough to work in a wide range of environments. Furthermore, by creating the code once and running the software anywhere, developers can simultaneously create applications for several systems.

Because of the compile and interpret nature of Java, any software written in it can be quickly run on any device that has[ a Java Virtual Machine](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3272244/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html) installed on it. This capability is a major reason why Java is still widely used in a variety of industries and why you may be confident that Java is here to stay.

# Blockchain Mobile Development

Blockchain sciences have gained prominence over the years, owing in significant part to the rise of cryptocurrencies. However, blockchain technology is not limited to cryptocurrencies; it was first proposed for tracking timestamps on scientific papers.

The benefit of this technology was that the timestamps — and other related information — on research papers were guaranteed to be accurate thanks to cryptography. Blockchain technology is now ubiquitous, especially on mobile phones, because of its meteoric rise in popularity. This means that Java, like mobile application development, is an ideal fit for mobile blockchain sciences.

# Web Development

It is critical to remember that, despite significant changes over the years, Java has remained a [mainstay in the web development industry](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-is-web-development). It is still widely used in web development for database management and other purposes.

Java is still used by developers to construct and add interactivity to web pages, significantly improving the user experience.

# Top skills Java developers need in 2023

Java developers are in charge of developing the program architecture for Java-based applications. They create, analyze, manage, and test Java code. Before creating a functional software system, they work with a team of developers and may need to work with clients on specific application requirements. After completing their coding work, Java developers deploy their product to confirm that an application operates effectively and meets the demands of a customer.

Here are the top Java developer abilities you need in order to be a competitive candidate in the information technology industry:

# 1. Java systems

Java has been updating its systems every few years ever since its inception around the year 2000. More recently, updates are being released every six months. Developers should be conversant with the system from the Java 8 iteration and should learn about the most recent revisions.

# 2. Java fundamentals

To work as a Java developer, you must have fundamental Java skills such as the following:

* Object-oriented programming (OOP): [This fundamental Java skill is used to combine objects in order to improve the safety](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP) and stability of a program.
* Design pattern abilities: A design pattern is a blueprint for solving problems in software development.
* Abstract classes: In OOP, abstraction is used to simplify coding. A Java interface is also used by developers for advanced coding.
* Serialization: This Java procedure turns items into byte streams that transmit objects between Java virtual machines.

# 3) Java build tools

Java build tools are used by developers to automate source code applications. They select from a variety of Java tools to finish projects. Some Java build tools that developers use include:

* [Apache](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/apache/)
* Gradle
* Bazel
* Sonatype
* CMake
* Nexus

# 4. Java EE components

Developers must know how to build server-side applications using EE components such as Java Beans, Java Server Pages, and Servlets.

# 5. Java testing tools

Java developers can work through various testing methods using tools such as TestNG and Selenium. A Java developer must be able to test their programming without the use of a web browser to launch the application.

# 6. Big data

Developers use Java coding to program stacks for the massive volumes of data stored in[ cloud-based platforms](https://unity-connect.com/our-resources/tech-insights/what-is-a-cloud-based-system-and-how-does-it-work/). Java developers should be familiar with the big data platforms Spark and Hadoop.

# 7. Artificial intelligence and machine learning

A Java developer can use both of these technologies to process massive amounts of data.

# 8. Java Virtual Machine

This abstract machine is used by Java programmers to load, execute, and verify code, as well as to create a run-time environment.

# How Much To Pay a Java Developer When Hiring?

When hiring a Java developer, it’s important to consider the position’s market value and make sure you’re paying a fair wage. There are many factors that can influence salary ranges, including education, certifications, additional skills, and years of experience.

When considering how much to pay a Java developer, it’s also important to consider the cost of living in your area.

## [Xtreme Mind – Extreme Power Alpha 3.0](https://healingcourse.net/xtreme-mind-extreme-power-alpha-3-0/)

**Don’t Just Compete – BLOW THEM AWAY!**

Care to turbo-charge your mind easily, effortlessly and automatically? How does acquiring an overpowering aura, magnetic charisma and indomitable personality sound?

Already curious? Wait! There’s still more… What about throbbing with endless vitality? Radiating unstoppable confidence? Experiencing amazing, drug-like states of well-being? Read on!

Fact: The mind is a supercomputer that can easily be re-tooled for unlimited potential. Science has long discovered many of the hard-wired connections that appear to give the brain immense influence over the body (wellness, vitality) and our destinies in terms of success, wealth and prosperity.

Now imagine accessing that supercomputer which can actually change your behavior from the inside out, maximizing your life in every area you desire?

The Extreme Power Level III is a set of unparalleled mind expansion tools. We designed it to rapidly help you transform your thoughts, actions, negative programming and limiting notions locked in your subconscious and replace them with empowering beliefs. Easily, Naturally, Effortlessly. All you do is kick back and listen to our Mind Re-Engineering sound tracks. No concentration or prior experience needed. You might be a shy man today, but a charismatic powerhouse tomorrow!

**Create Trandenscental Brainstates with EP3!**

Sounds like magic? Far from it. We’ve taken advanced extreme subliminal technology, combined it with cutting-edge binaural beat matrices and infused it with NLP behavioral change techniques…. all to quickly and permanently energize you with an amazing breakthrough mental overhaul:

**Three Technologies**

**1, BrainEngine (TM)**

* Building upon the wildly successful Deep Mind series developed by Exceed Global in 1999, the CD harmonics irresistibly nudge the user from the hectic Beta brain state down into the euphoric Theta state where hypnotic reprogramming easily penetrates the mind and unleashes a payload of life-enhancing suggestions.
* Seeming to come from within your own consciousness, these suggestions ultimately hotwire your brain and spark radical change.. to unlimited possibilities.
* There’s more. Our BrainEngine Technology uniquely resonate at frequencies that theoretically attune your subtle energy centers (chakras)
* You will experience throbbing sensations, a lightening of your spirit and a sudden expansion of your consciousness.
* Flashes of light may criscross your mental screen as various parts of your body heat literally up.
* Don’t worry, it’s just your mind altering to accommodate to the released energy. In time (a week at the most), you will adjust to the your elevated energy levels and these wild sensations will minimize. Think of it like taking a roller coaster ride into the astral planes of your psyche.

**2, Subliminal programming**

* Embedded within the binaural harmonic matrix are irresistible suggestions crafted to transform your behavior and recreate you into a powerhouse of charisma, energy and boundless vitality.
* Within the first few minutes, the suggestions will barely be audible, but as you sink into an altered state of consciousness, your mind will fully hear them, absorbing them like a sponge and smoothly integrating them into your being.
* A note about our subliminals: One track of the subliminal recording is played at a whisper level that you may hear as you sink into an altered state. The second track is played at an ultrasonic frequency similar to the SilentSound (TM) technology utilized by competitors.
* This track will NEVER be heard by your conscious mind, but it is undeniably picked up by your subconscious.
* What makes ours special is that the ultrasonic frequency we use sweeps from 8000Hz to 16500Hz ; it naturally bypasses your normal hearing process and your “conscious filters” and pumps the commands directly into your brain through the middle ear. It simultaneously endows an energy boost through the famous Tomatis effect.

**3, NLP**

* As we are well aware Neurolinguistic Programming is naturally the most persuasive form of communication ever created now.
* What if NLP where used on YOU to reshape your mind for the better? Our CD deploys subliminal suggestions crafted with NLP affirmations in the imperative and permissive modes to home in on both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. To date, we are one of the few to utilize such techniques.

**What You Get**

After witnessing the success of our products, and to make the technology more accessible, we’ve decided to combine all three formulations into ONE power-packed CD, the Extreme Power System Level III Mind Re-Engineer Program.

Each formulation is an MP3 -Pro recording. You can play it on your computer, your home MP3 player or upload it onto your Ipod!

**The following explains the formulations:**

**Aura Explosion** Many esoteric systems refer to the subtle energy centers (ki) of the body. Yoga, for instance, developed chi breathing to fully circulate the energy and attain progressive states of supreme well-being.

You can now allow this life energy to flow freely through you! As you listen to the Aura Explosion track, you will naturally release blockages, expand your energy field at least 12ft, and gain a sense of bliss and mental expansion! If you’ve enjoyed the techniques of PS5 to expand your aura, you can easily put your mind into a perpetual energy absorption mode, swelling your protective aura 24 hours a day, seven days a week! How does it work? The harmonics theoretically resonate at chakra specific frequencies thereby inducing extreme relaxation and a release of surplus chi.

Combined with Theta-Delta level harmonics, the Aura Explosion MP3 cascades your subconscious with affirmations designed to release the energy flow. Why would you want to increase your life force?

**Two good reason.**

1) Increased stamina and immunity.

2) Increased charisma: people are irresistibly drawn to those emanating tremendous vitality.

* **Instant Charisma** Did you ever lack the confidence to enjoy new friends and fulfilling romantic relationships? Self-limiting beliefs interfere with your ability to successfully relate with others. The Instant Charisma MP3 track on your CD guides you down an altered state of hypnotic trance and gently washes your mind of mental debris that cause shyness, timidity, and abrasiveness. Your thoughts are then gently reprogrammed to acquire the mind-set and behaviors of naturally charismatic people. Observe your surprisingly magnetic personality within four weeks of listening!
* **Power Assertiveness** Do you have difficulty getting others to take your opinions seriously. Do you even doubt the validity of your own perspectives? Use this Power Assertiveness MP3 track and learn to appreciate yourself more. Discover how effortlessly you can stand up for your convictions, sway people to your beliefs, counter unreasonable arguments, gain brimming self confidence, muster exemplary courage and assume the reins of leadership. Why be a follower when you can take command? Infused with a matrix of theta harmonics, our powerful NLP suggestions build up the assertive new you within four weeks.

**And yet more benefits??**

Due to the unique technology involved, mind programming is just one of the advantages the Extreme Power System III provides.

**Here are yet more guaranteed benefits:**

**Need for less sleep**

* With just 60 minutes of listening to a track, you will have replaced 5 hours of sleep. The special MP3 harmonics effortlessly recreate the theta brainwave patterns in your head

206,133,140cqj,brainstation,I overslept and had nightmares. My brainstate is such that I can't think or plan properly right now. : p,bipolar,None,2012-11-29 14:46,2,"I think it's the SSRIs that give me the really intense dreams. They're not nightmares, as such. There are no monsters, I'm not being chased by wolves. But they are very, very intense and distressing. So I guess maybe they are nightmares. Right before I woke up I was in a plane with a couple of other people and my best friend Dan (I only have one friend named Dan and we're not particularly close. Dream logic, amirite?). Apparently we're going to try a new kind of parachute drop. As we're coming in on the drop location I realize that we're only a few hundred feet from the ground. Dan jumps and I see him hit hard bounce, and run into the side of a [Tree/Barn](it's both things at the same time. Dreams!). Then I jump, and for half a second I'm desperately trying to find the pull cord to release my parachute. Just as I grab the cords I hit the ground and roll - I had only fallen a few feet and I was able to get up and move, though painfully. A bunch of other people, presumably from the plane, were moving over to where Dan (again, I have no idea who Dan is) had landed. I'm trying to get over there but my legs ache and I'm moving slowly. At the same time I'm wondering if I'm actually hurt, or just too weak of mind to deal with a mild amount of pain and get moving. I get to where Dan hit the [Tree] and he's gone. I look around for him but I can't find him. 

Then I wake up, feeling awful and stressed out and scared. I spent a good half hour (I think; My time sense is bad at the best of times) with my eyes screwed shut trying not to think about anything. I only go up when I remembered that never works. 

I found my phone. I'd left my music player on to shuffle overnight and it drained the battery completely; My alarm didn't go off as a result. I think I slept about 13-14 hours all told. I usually get nightmares when that happens. 

I know there were things I was supposed to do today, but I'm not having much luck with them. I tried playing vidjya games for a bit but I couldn't shake the feeling of low anxiety coiled up in my guts. Now I'm just kinda of doddering around, waiting for my sesh with my head shrinker. : p"

# Project Ideas:

Each aforementioned course has its set of projects/exercises. However, if you want to build a stronger portfolio, or if you want to challenge yourself and learn more, we encourage you to start building additional projects: 

&#x200B;

1.Social Media Campaign Analysis:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c02oytmes7m91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6960539463cfedc5ce787a0ccb8203761a6a1a78

You can approach digital agencies to help out in analyzing their campaigns. Mostly all agencies do have someone in-house but they wouldn’t mind some pro-bono help because campaigns are conducted for every brand, be it paid or organic. And results are very important to make future decisions. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2. SEO Study of Websites

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rhl3weqs7m91.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=880c1ecb96cea70522f0b574d474ae7fe3c52046

Firstly, learn SEO using online courses and get a thorough idea about the concepts. Pick out a few websites of your choice and start implementing your knowledge. Try to give suggestions as to what better keywords can be used, whether the URL can be customized, backlinks, etc. Prepare a report on SEO strategies as per the websites you have analyzed. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3. CRO Marketing Case Study

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjw6ihoxs7m91.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9afea1ee068ee59394ad8b6418390f384572b66c

CRO or conversion rate optimization is the systematic process of optimizing the number of visitors to your website who take a certain action. This action can be anything from filling a form, making a purchase, sharing personal information, etc.

A CRO marketing strategy case study is a good project idea when you are getting started.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

4. Create your own Website/Blogging:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gu3q5no4t7m91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33fa3be33d3353642d6fc057808a9000ef878c77

 This is the most interesting project you could undertake. This will help you practice almost all concepts of digital marketing like content development, SEO, email marketing, and even SEM. You could learn about how to develop a high-ranking website.

From this, you could also create Google Analytics reports which would help you to understand various website metrics like session time, bounce rate, number of unique visitors, etc.  


By doing this you’ll not only get excellent practice before you start on a full-fledged job, you’ll also have a whole website that you can add to your portfolio. This will help distinguish you from your competitors.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

5. Keyword Research:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ed4oto0dt7m91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f41638bda001c6ad7063bce6012c32f23df4f3c4

Yes, this can be a project of its own because there is a rising demand for tools that would give the business-relevant keywords, resulting in a measurable outcome. Pick out a website, and understand its niche.  


Use a keyword tool like Google Trends or Google Keywords Planner, to search for keywords that would best suit the business needs. Try to create charts having long-tail keywords, and explain why the keywords you have chosen are apt.

This will not only enhance your knowledge about keywords in general, but it will also help you to understand how important a role they play in increasing the visibility of the website and even in increasing sales.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

6. Online Reputation Management for an NGO/Small Business

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nspdzp5ht7m91.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30aa4d573b587437bce42bc9f1b7ee512ee26044

Customer satisfaction is imperative for a company’s growth and sustainability. This is where online reputation management comes into play as it is also how a customer perceives your brand. 

Reach out to a digital marketing agency and understand how they manage online reputation management by conduction a survey. Today, there are multiple tools available for online reputation management. Understand which ones they use and why is it their preferred choice.

218,145,xoqtz1,brainstation,Anyone else wonder why meditation is so effective in improving both mental and physical health?,Meditation,Quixotic_Monk,2022-09-26 14:04,17,"don’t get me wrong, needless to say I’m extremely grateful that this activity has such a great potential in improving my mental and physical health. i just watched a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/9skSLIZqKTw) from university of california, and was extremely surprised to see that meditation also has the ability of increasing gene / telomerase activity for promoting health and wellness, sometimes even SEVENTEEN TIMES from baseline.  

does it surprise anyone else that this practice is so effective in improve health not just mentally, but also physically? i mean, it’s not as surprising that over time with regular practice there are measurable changes and improvements in the brain from meditation, since it’s clear that it’s a mental activity anyways. but to also promote genetic health was shocking news to me. 

it almost seems like nature wants us, or incentivizes us as humans to mediate, due to its sheer effectiveness in promoting general health. but this is a very interesting thought for me; other activities like exercise and love / social bonding also promote health and happiness, but these are not as surprising to me as they both fall in accordance to our lifestyles as earlier humans and what allowed us to survive and prosper. (frequently moving and exercising induced improvements in physical capability, increasing chances of survival, so my guess is that our biology made exercise a naturally rewarding sensation, same with gaining satisfaction from fulfilling social and romantic bonds as you are more likely to survive within a group of humans)

meditation on the other hand seems to me like an abstract, intentional activity that i’m assuming only the homo sapien brain can accomplish, and this is the reason for my surprise towards its biological effectiveness. anyone else wonder the same thing? how is an intentional mental practice that is unique to our species such a biologically rewarding thing to do?

originally i would’ve expected it to be something more similar to how basically only humans are capable of creating and playing music. i know that musicians brains are strengthened in regions relating to music, but as far as i’m aware, being a musician doesn’t have the same potential in improving general physical health like meditation. in this way meditation seems interestingly unique to me in it’s almost “magical” health benefits. what do you guys think?"
219,146,xdeavk,brainstation,Looking for an affordable Graphic Design course to launch a career in the industry,learndesign,Geekyboy2002,2022-09-13 14:12,9,"Hey everyone,

My fiancee has been pursuing a graphic design degree for a few months now since her job offers her free college. However, recently some issues at work have left her wanting to leave her job, and her dislike of the curriculum at her university has left her ok with leaving that as well. I took a coding bootcamp at Brainstation a while back and I thought that the same sort of learning style might work great for her. However, we're not in a great place financially yet to be paying for an expensive bootcamp up front, or even really in large monthly installments (such as a two year plan). Deferred tuition also seems like a great option because we'd only have to pay once she's making more money.

So I guess we're looking for a Graphic Design course that is:

\- Financially affordable, e.g. deferred tuition, under $15k, longer payment plans for lower monthly installments

\- Not too rigorous as to be overwhelming, but still rigorous enough to be valuable, e.g. part time alternatives to the main course, still allows for weekend freedom

\- Prepares for an entry-level career in graphic design

221,148,uvpq07,brainstation,Low Cost MBA in Business Analytics from Sprott School of Business?,PersonalFinanceCanada,reddletomp,2022-05-22 22:03,7," Hi there, I was wondering if I could get some guidance on whether to pursue an MBA program at Carleton University (Sprott School of Business) or take a Data Science boot camp through an online company called Brainstation.io. 

A bit about myself:

\- I’m 31 years old  
\- Married and planning to have kids within 3 years  
\- I did my undergrad in Human Biology in Neuroscience and Psychology with a minor in Professional Writing at UofT (it’s been pretty much useless in the workforce)  
\- I co-founded and scaled mobile app company from a local Toronto start up to operating across North America  
\- I’ve been running this company for 5 years and looking to re-enter the job market  
\- Mainly I was responsible for the Operations side of the business and would most likely have a skill set of an Operations Manager if I worked at another larger company.   
\- I’m trying to keep my costs low if I can.  
\- I feel that I need to get some sort of technical skill.

Currently, I’m looking to re-enter the workforce. I feel like for my experience with running my own company to be taken more seriously and for me to earn more I’d need to couple my experience/skills set with some type of further education. I also feel that because I’m planning to start a family within 3 years pursuing further education afterwards may be more challenging so it makes more sense to start now. The reason I looked at Carleton’s MBA program was because it was low cost ($13k) and online so I can work while still pursuing the MBA. I also found that I have an interest and skills that would be suited in data/business analytics as well as management. The Sprott School of Business offers a concentration in analytics so that’s another reason why I like it. I understand Carleton (Sprott School of Business) doesn’t have the name recognition as Rotman or Schulich but I think it’s reasonable to assume that having an MBA could provide my job market value a 13k immediate bump which means the cost of the program pays for itself within a year. 

Additionally, I’m thinking of coupling this with a PMP within the 3 years as well to further maximize my value. 

Alternatively, I was looking at a Data Science boot camp offered by Brainstation for $15k. This is because they offer a relatively short program and I enjoyed analytics portion of running my own business. Also, it seems like it would provide me with some sort of technical skill that I can use in the workforce.

Would you recommend pursuing the MBA education based on the information I provided to help my career path? Or is it better to complete the data science bootcamp?"

I have my masters in I/O psychology so I have a little experience with statistics and psychometrics. I have found a ton of boot camps online, and was wondering if any of you have taken one, and if so, which do you recommend? 

The ones I am currently considering are 
1. BrainStation Data Analytics Course
2. Career Foundry Data Analytics Program
3. General Assembly Online Data Analytics Course 

I landed on these three because they are all part time and somewhat reasonably priced. The Career Foundry one is double the price of the other two and just about twice as long. I wasn’t able to gauge from the curriculums what I would be missing if I went with the BrainStation/General Assembly courses. 

Any insight would be great! TIA"

Either way, what remains of his career is a cancelled game series, extended online harassment, a mountain of controversial takes, and almost complete radio silence after several online meltdowns that may or may not be warranted. 

Trigger Warnings: Harassment, Death Threats, and Discussion of Misogyny. Also, while only a small portion of this write up, I will be discussing Gamergate so fair warning in advance.

NOTE: Phil Fish has deleted his Twitter account numerous times, and as such all of these sources will be from secondhand sources. If you’re interested in reading an alternative summary of the situation, I heavily recommend Innuendo Studios’ [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTUW-owa2w). Though it is about much more than Phil Fish despite its title, it is a fantastic and well articulated documentary on the incident and how public perception shaped his reputation.

Video game developers, as I mentioned in a [previous write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/pekgis/video_games_on_good_intentions_and_broken/), can often double as public figures in an industry that makes billions in profits each year. Due to this, some are almost always in the limelight, constantly communicating with fans and announcing updates on their life and new projects. Others choose to have a quieter online feed when they can, stepping into the public eye only when they have to. And some, like Phil Fish… just can’t seem to escape falling into controversy after controversy.

**The 2000s: A Promising Developer**

Phil Fish was the definition of an ‘indie darling’ since he first gained prominence in the gaming industry. Following his graduation from a Design and Digital Art program in Montreal, Fish was quick to enter the gaming scene with a short stint at gaming giant Ubisoft. Though initially excited, the developer would quickly find himself disillusioned working for a big developer and restrained in a stifling work environment. After eventually being fired by the company, he would bounce around from project to project and formed the development group [Kokoromi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoromi), dedicated to promoting experimental games and concepts. 

This ambition would ultimately culminate in the announcement of his own independently created project. First announced on the TIGSource forums, a site for independent developers to show off and talk about their creations and other topics, Fish would discuss his [first intentions for the game](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=354.0) in July 2007. A simple puzzle platformer where the player could rotate the screen to change the landscape, simply called [*Fez*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_(video_game)), took the forums by storm for its clean artstyle and unique mechanics by its [very first preview](https://www.tigsource.com/2007/07/27/early-preview-fez/). It wouldn’t stop there, with Fish and his small development team picking up numerous accolades and press attention in the coming months for his burgeoning creation. By early 2008, following disputes with the game company he was employed by at the time after not being allowed to attend an award ceremony he was nominated for, Fish would leave and fully dedicate himself to becoming an ‘indie developer’. As he stated a year later in an [interview with Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/going-indie-fez-creator-phil-fishs-moment-of-clarity-5219689) on working with a big company:

>\[Phil Fish\]: ""The way these people make games, it's so horrible,"" he says. ""Hundred of people on your team, you don't know any of their names. It's so big and impersonal."" Some people find ways to persevere, to grow in that environment, Fish adds — like weeds pushing up through cracks in concrete.

Using a [government grant](https://brainstation.io/magazine/telefilm-canada-provides-funding-to-indepent-video-games) to fund his own studio, Polytron, and continue development, Fish would continue to receive critical acclaim and grew a sizable audience waiting with great anticipation for when *Fez* would finally release.

**The Lead Up to 2012: An Arduous Development**

The development logs of *Fez* would become one of the most popular threads on TIGSource, and Fish himself would become increasingly well known in the industry as an up and coming, accolade winning developer. But this would also propel Fish into the public eye, and with that fame came an increasing awareness of the more abrasive side of his personality. On TIGSource and Twitter, Fish was an erratic developer open about his emotional state through constant updates on the game. And as *Fez*’s arduous five year development cycle continued, the lead developer would experience a serious deterioration of his mental health that was very public. Polytron would face near bankruptcy numerous times, only saved by a last minute partnership, and constant delays of the game seemingly everyone was waiting for would loom over Fish every day.

Perhaps this was best highlighted in [*Indie Game: The Movie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_Game:_The_Movie), a 2012 documentary following Fish and other independent game developers through the issues they faced getting their work out to the public. The creator was shown at his most vulnerable as he encountered countless issues finalizing the project his fame and respect were attached to. Facing financial difficulties, a legal dispute with a former colleague, and growing exasperation over glacial development: the documentary and Fish himself made it clear this was more than just a game for the young talent. 

Fish stating firmly to the camera that he was considering ending his life if *Fez* was not finished is considered by many to be the most impactful moment of the film to this day. [Reviews like Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-06-indie-game-the-movie-review) summed up the interview’s intensity and how it opened a window into the issues developers like Fish faced.

>Fish, meanwhile, is heartbreakingly invested in a game he can't finish for his own perfectionism. ""It's me, my ego. My identity is at risk. It's my perception of myself,"" he says of Fez. In the film's most startling moment, he's asked what he will do if he doesn't finish the game. ""I will kill myself,"" he replies, meaning it. ""That's my incentive to finish it."" The flash of black humour relieves the tension, but it's an alarming vision of a man in desperate times. 

Fish himself would further discuss the deterioration of his mental and physical health working on the game in a [Game Developer interview](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-making-of-i-fez-i-the-breaking-of-phil-fish) before the film’s release. Just like his big screen portrayal, the developer was open about the anguish and fatigue he went through finally finishing the game. Yet, he was also hopeful that this he could inspire someone to pursue games the same way he had.

>\[Phil Fish}: It's such a thrill when you meet somebody that had an impact on you; that would be a huge reward for me, if somebody walked up to me and said that one day. I feel like I will have left my mark on the medium, which is an honor. I can feel really lucky to be doing what I'm doing. I complain a lot, and it's hard and it's really difficult, but I am damn lucky to be doing exactly what I want.

*Fez* would finally release in April 2012, initially as an Xbox 360 timed exclusive, to critical and commercial success. The game would gain near universal acclaim for its simplistic but well polished mechanics and fantastic art style that felt like a loving throwback to the games of Fish’s youth. After so many years, and an agonizing development period, it seemed that all of the trials Polytron and Fish went through were finally rewarded. If this was any other developer, at any other point, this would be a time for joy. But unfortunately, Phil Fish was a man open about his struggles, quick to comment online, and unable to escape criticism, deserved or not.

**2012: A Successful Game, Riddled by Controversy**

Though *Fez* had quickly garnered the acclaim that the development team wanted, it would not be a completely joyous time as Fish had already become mired in controversy. In March 2012, a month before the launch of his magnum opus, Fish attended as a panelist for a Q&A about *Indie Game: The Movie*. Makoto Goto, a seasoned Japanese game developer who contributed to massive projects like *Final Fantasy XIII*, asked Fish and the other panelists about their opinion on the landscape of recent Japanese games. Fish immediately replied that [they sucked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKUGwlFJAHw).

He elaborated a bit, and the other panelists shared some of their own criticisms on the gaming landscape in Japan at the time, but it was a small quip that blew up into a dramatic fiasco online. Though Fish would reach out to Goto and [apologize to him over Twitter](https://kotaku.com/japanese-games-just-suck-target-speaks-out-452565578), the damage was already done as he was swamped by critics and trolls from both the East and West. Doubling down on his less than [tactful criticisms online certainly didn’t help](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/10/fez-creator-gamers-are-the-worst-fing-people/), nor did telling someone via Twitter to “suck my dick. choke on it.” after winning the grand prize at the Independent Games Festival around the same time. Even his win was called into question by critics, who argued Fish entering *Fez* at the contest to win the $30,000 reward in funding a month before its launch, after he already entered and won with a prototype of the same game before in 2008, was suspect. 

Fish’s troubles with *Fez* wouldn’t end with its release, as the game had numerous glitches and other significant issues. Polytron would push an update out in June, before immediately recalling it after realizing the patch could delete save files. After some silence, Polytron and Fish announced they would not fix the patch, saying it would cost them [thousands in payments to Microsoft](https://kotaku.com/fez-wont-be-fixed-because-microsoft-wants-a-ton-of-mone-5927224) and affected a miniscule amount of players. Microsoft would eventually report in June of 2013 that the company did away with the fees quietly a few months earlier, causing [Fish to publicly criticize](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-26-microsoft-no-longer-charges-developers-to-patch-their-xbox-360-games) the company for being quiet and finally fixing the game breaking bug. 

Fish continued to [burn bridges with Microsoft](https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/27/4471162/phil-fish-slams-microsoft-over-lack-of-support-for-fez) during this time with his criticisms about lack of support and promotion while *Fez* was still a timed exclusive, but the patching fiasco only fueled annoyance with the developer’s public persona and ego. Gamers and indie developers had an air of hostility towards the ‘indie darling’ everyone seemed to praise since *Fez* blew up, with Fish being branded as prideful to a fault and undeserving of the countless awards and media attention he received for a game that took half a decade to finish. His abrasive personality and rants online fueled perception of him as an arrogant creator with a big ego, deserved or not. 

And with that constant spotlight, Fish would only attract more and more negative attention until he finally, and some would say inevitably, snapped.

**2013: The Feud Heard Around the Industry**

By late 2013, most of the goodwill *Fez* had bought Fish and Polytron had faded with the passage of time and the creator’s many public feuds. Another rant in April that year after *Fez*’s PC release, stating he should be [charging more](https://nerdybutflirty.com/2013/04/28/fez-pre-order-announced-on-steam-phil-fish-freak-out-ensues/) and calling gamers “ingrates”, added fuel to an ever burning fire. It was easily suspected that Fish’s mental health hadn’t fully recovered between the game’s release and the many controversies he was embroiled in. But one last public callout would ultimately lead him to cancel the recently teased sequel to his acclaimed project.

Marcus Beer, a journalist at Game Trailers at the time, was most well known for his Annoyed Gamer series where he would discuss news, controversies, and rant about recent topics in the game industry. In July 2013, he would deliver an off the cuff rant during a podcast discussing how Phil Fish and fellow indie developer Johnathan Blow, both featured in *Indie Game: The Movie*, refused to comment to the press about Microsoft’s new policies on independent development for the upcoming Xbox One. [Beer was incensed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm5Lnei4S6M&t=44s), referring to the two combined as “Blowfish” and “f—king hipsters” that should be thankful for the press coming to them after years of media praise and promotion for their past projects. Though Blow more or less shrugged the highly controversial callout off, Fish responded with his own [rant on Twitter](https://4playernetwork.com/blog/2013/07/how-phil-fish-killed-fez-2-and-possibly-his-career/), telling Blow to kill himself among other things. This would be the breaking point for Fish after years of struggle and public controversy. As Polytron confirmed in a [later tweet](https://twitter.com/Polytron/status/361188665709436928?s=20), Fish would post on the company’s website stating *Fez 2* was cancelled and that he would be quitting the game industry:

>\[Phil Fish\]: ""FEZ II is cancelled.  
>  
>i am done.  
>  
>i take the money and i run.  
>  
>this is as much as i can stomach.  
>  
>this is isn’t the result of any one thing, but the end of a long, bloody campaign.  
>  
>you win.""

As stated before, it seemed inevitable that Fish would have blown up sooner or later. Regardless of if criticisms laid at him were fair or the conduct of certain critics, the gaming community and other developers simply viewed him as a volatile person who didn’t deserve the respect he garnered. Warranted or not, Fish was a social pariah that people loved to hate, and even at his most hurt and apologetic ([even expressing his pain towards Marcus Beer](https://i.imgur.com/bCdgM63.png) mid-rant), very few felt he was genuine. But this wouldn't be the end of Fish’s stay in the limelight. Things were about to get much worse

**2014: Enter Gamergate**

Fish would jump out of hiding now and then in 2014 even after deleting his account, posting callouts and causing fights online wherever he went. He even stated that youtubers [owe ad revenue to game developers](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fez-creator-phil-fish-youtubers-should-pay-game-devs-huge-portion-of-revenue/1100-6420573/) for playing their games after it was revealed Pewdiepie made $4 million a year in ads at the time, before deleting his Twitter again of course. After all this, it seemed Fish would simply continue to pop up every few months, constantly striking the flames in a never ending cycle of controversy.

That would all abruptly change in August.

By this point, the #Gamergate movement was in full swing. Accusations that game developer Zoe Quinn had slept with Kotaku game journalist Nathan Grayson for a favorable review on her recently released project, *Depression Quest*, ignited media and community frenzy. Though Kotaku would [defend both of the accused](https://kotaku.com/in-recent-days-ive-been-asked-several-times-about-a-pos-1624707346), asserting there was no quid-pro-quo involved and Nathan never even reviewed the game, it was too late to stop the uproar that demanded ‘ethics in game journalism’. Press outlets and online personalities all took sides, fueling the online flame wars and harassment of many figures like Quinn that social media fueled each day.

Phil Fish, friends with Zoe Quinn at the time, would immediately rush to defend the accused. Shortly after, both developers were doxxed and Fish’s account, along with Polytron’s own website and Twitter account, [would be hacked and taken over](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/4chan-hacks-phil-fish-over-his-defense-of-zoe-quinn/).

Some disputed if the self-proclaimed culprit, an anonymous user on 4Chan message board /v/, was truly involved judging from the differences between this hack and normal raids at the time. Regardless, the culprit would launch into the same old tirade on Twitter and the company’s website, accusing Fish of being one of the many pompous and unethical developers ruining the game industry. Referencing a conspiracy about Quinn sleeping with five people while dating her ex-boyfriend (trust me, this is not a fun rabbit hole), the hacker leaked all of Fish’s personal information including addresses, passwords, and bank account info before stating they would come after other “SJW developers” next. 

The accounts and website would be reverted back shortly after, but Fish would lock and delete his Twitter one more time after announcing *Fez* and *Polytron* were up for sale and swearing off the game industry once again in a deleted Twitter post. Seemingly done for good, and wishing to [burn down the industry](https://playbackgaming.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/phil-fish-is-a-nutcase.png?w=940) he once loved, his last [message to other developers](https://imgur.com/uDIaZkE) summarized his feelings best:

>\[Phil Fish\]: this is videogames  
>  
>this is your audience  
>  
>to every aspiring game developer out there: don’t. give up. it’s not worth it.  
>  
>nothing is worth this.  
>  
>give up on your dreams. they are actually nightmares.  
>  
>just don’t do it.  
>  
>RUN AWAY

**Aftermath**

Fish has largely kept quiet since, though even now he isn’t completely gone. In 2016, he took part in a small promotional video for a long awaited VR project by Kokoromi (remember that group from so long ago?), [*SuperHyperCube*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlWppbpV56A). He also took part in a [small interview with Giant Bomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/phil-fishs-2017-game-of-the-year/1100-5696/), praising his favorite games of 2017. But aside from a few small projects here and there, Fish has remained silent on any possible return to game development and social media.

Polytron would continue as a publisher of sorts, still advertising past projects like *Fez* to this day. As for the game itself? It’s clear by now a sequel will likely never be made, if Fish ever makes another game at all. Though still an indie gem for many, the project’s reputation is in shambles under the shadow of its controversial creator.

**Conclusion**

There is nothing that can really be said about this entire fiasco that makes anyone look remotely clean. As *Fez* approaches its ten year anniversary since release, it seems Fish is content with staying away from the limelight for good, and you certainly can’t blame him. Fact is, Fish was simply someone many could dislike, for one reason or another. Whether it be his terrible takes, his dramatic Twitter feuds, his perception as ‘undeserving’ or ‘narcissistic’ by gamers and developers, or even simply as a scapegoat for the frustrations by the Gamergate crowd: there were a lot of different groups with a lot of different reasons, fair or not, to dislike him.

He was not innocent, or nice, or respectful, or a bunch of other qualities that turned people off from the creator so quickly. The developer’s unhealthy attachment to social media certainly helped sink his career faster than almost anything his critics did. But Phil Fish did not deserve to be harassed, or doxxed, or be a target for some of the weirdest and most outrageous claims a developer could ever be subjected to during his short time in the industry. 

If Phil Fish ever miraculously decides to return to developing games and creating art publicly, who knows what the reaction will be. He should definitely stay away from Twitter now more than ever if his history is any indication. But today, all that’s left is a destroyed reputation and a dead game series from a once promising developer."

Em outras palavras, um [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/) não é diferente de qualquer outro profissional de marketing digital ou marketing tradicional: eles estão tentando gerar mais vendas para a empresa para a qual estão trabalhando.

&#x200B;

Ao realizar pesquisas de palavras-chave e alavancar ferramentas de SEO, como o Google Analytics, um especialista em SEO pode aumentar a visibilidade de um site no Google, o que por sua vez traz grandes benefícios para qualquer empresa. Alguns também podem trabalhar em estreita colaboração com outros membros de uma equipe de marketing para desenvolver novas iniciativas ou gerenciar melhor as contas de mídia social para aumentar o envolvimento e o tráfego do usuário.

&#x200B;

Quais são as responsabilidades do trabalho de especialista em SEO?

As responsabilidades do trabalho de especialista em SEO variam de acordo com se alguém está trabalhando para uma agência de marketing digital, no departamento de marketing digital de uma empresa ou como freelancer para um cliente, mas a descrição do trabalho para a grande maioria das postagens de especialista em SEO incluirá todos ou a maioria a seguir:

De onde vêm os especialistas em SEO?

A maioria dos especialistas em SEO e outros profissionais de otimização de mecanismos de busca começam sua carreira em outro campo antes de trabalhar em suas habilidades técnicas e alavancar suas habilidades transferíveis e formação educacional para se mudar para um emprego em SEO.

&#x200B;

Não há diploma de faculdade ou universidade relacionado diretamente ao SEO - e certamente nenhum programa de marketing de quatro anos lhe dará as habilidades técnicas específicas que você precisa para prosperar no campo de SEO - mas é raro ver uma descrição de trabalho para um [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/) que não liste um bacharelado ou equivalente em algum tipo de campo relacionado, como negócios, marketing ou comunicações.

&#x200B;

A maioria dos especialistas em SEO que trabalham na área buscam algum tipo de certificação adicional para mostrar aos empregadores que eles têm as habilidades específicas necessárias para executar sua estratégia de marketing digital, aumentar o tráfego do mecanismo de pesquisa e garantir que seu site esteja próximo do topo nas páginas de resultados do mecanismo de pesquisa. Cursos como o Curso Certificado de Otimização de Mecanismos de Busca da BrainStation também permitirão que você crie um trabalho real que demonstre suas habilidades, e será criado sob a instrução de um profissional da indústria de SEO que sabe o que os empregadores estão procurando.

&#x200B;

Mesmo que você tenha um diploma relevante, o aprimoramento com um curso de certificação ou outro curso on-line provavelmente será necessário para provar que você está no topo do mundo em constante mudança do SEO.

&#x200B;

Características de um especialista em SEO de sucesso?

Aqui estão algumas das principais características que os especialistas em SEO bem-sucedidos devem ter para prosperar no mundo do marketing digital e da otimização de mecanismos de busca:

&#x200B;

1. Uma compreensão dos três níveis de SEO

Existem três níveis para otimização de mecanismos de pesquisa e qualquer bom especialista em SEO deve manter todos os três em mente ao desenvolver uma estratégia de marketing:

&#x200B;

Técnico  refere-se aos elementos sem conteúdo do seu site. Esta seção inclui estratégias para melhorar a estrutura de back-end e a base de um site. Parte deste trabalho envolverá a realização de uma análise completa do site, que pode descobrir oportunidades para SEO técnico para melhorar a velocidade do site, indexação, compatibilidade com dispositivos móveis, rastreabilidade e arquitetura do site. O SEO técnico também melhorará crucialmente a legibilidade de um site, o que, por sua vez, melhora a experiência do usuário e mostra aos mecanismos de pesquisa que o site é bom.

O SEO na página  está relacionado ao conteúdo do seu site e sua otimização para ajudar os mecanismos de pesquisa a entender o tópico do seu conteúdo e ver o site como um recurso valioso. O SEO na página inclui o uso de elementos como palavras-chave, metatags, links internos e tags de título HTML de forma a ajudar a aumentar o tráfego do mecanismo de pesquisa e garantir que ele esteja próximo do topo dos resultados do Google.

A otimização fora da página  trata da criação de um relacionamento mais forte entre seu site e outros sites por meio de uma variedade de táticas de criação de links. A otimização fora da página também inclui estratégias para construir a reputação de um site para mostrar aos mecanismos de pesquisa que um site é uma fonte confiável e, portanto, deve ser posicionado próximo ao topo das classificações dos mecanismos de pesquisa.

Os especialistas em SEO precisam saber como todos os níveis de otimização de mecanismos de pesquisa contribuem para o destaque do seu site entre os resultados de pesquisa do Google.

&#x200B;

2. Uma mente experiente para marketing

Os aspectos técnicos do SEO são obviamente uma grande parte do trabalho, e entender os problemas que podem estar fazendo com que o Google enterre seu site nos resultados da pesquisa é crucial. Mas depois de superar isso, os trabalhos na indústria de SEO tendem a ter muito em comum com outros trabalhos de marketing digital ou até mesmo de marketing tradicional: em última análise, você precisa criar e posicionar conteúdo para que ele descreva o benefício do consumidor enquanto cutuca aproximando-os de uma venda.

&#x200B;

A parte complicada é criar conteúdo que seja atraente tanto para as pessoas do outro lado do mecanismo de pesquisa quanto para agradar um algoritmo do Google. Isso vem com a experiência.

&#x200B;

Mas a experiência em SEO necessária para realmente se conectar como [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/) e profissional de marketing digital de maneira mais ampla é mais profunda do que isso. Para realmente ter sucesso em uma função de SEO, você deve sempre considerar o marketing de conteúdo em um nível mais profundo, bem como a psicologia do consumidor e o público-alvo para quem você está comercializando, o cenário de mídia social, design e desenvolvimento da web, estratégias de marketing viral, e metas gerais de negócios que ajudam a aumentar o reconhecimento da marca e as conversões.

&#x200B;

3. Uma capacidade de pensar em grande escala

Como estabelecemos, SEO toca tudo. E os sites das empresas são tão importantes que o SEO não pode ser desconectado do restante dessas considerações.

&#x200B;

Isso ajuda a ter objetivos específicos em torno de campanhas de SEO. Como [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/), seu objetivo é se concentrar nos rankings dos mecanismos de pesquisa, direcionar tráfego, aumentar o reconhecimento da marca ou conversões (transformar alguém que visita seu site em um cliente)?

&#x200B;

Definir esses objetivos e, em seguida, ser capaz de manter os objetivos maiores da organização em mente enquanto executa uma estratégia de SEO preparará um especialista em SEO para o sucesso.

&#x200B;

4. Habilidades de comunicação de alto nível e espírito colaborativo

Um especialista em SEO trabalhará com uma ampla variedade de departamentos em uma empresa, incluindo vendas, atendimento ao cliente, desenvolvimento web, análise, TI, marketing e muito mais. E nem sempre é fácil explicar por que fazer alterações em um site aumentará o SEO e resultará em mais tráfego e conversões. É aí que suas habilidades de comunicação entram em jogo.

&#x200B;

Especialistas em SEO precisam saber explicar de forma persuasiva e acessível por que certas mudanças são necessárias e como elas beneficiarão o site e os resultados da empresa. Além disso, parte do seu trabalho é poder fazer isso com equipes de diferentes origens e perspectivas no site.

&#x200B;

Não apenas isso, mas você pode estar envolvido no conteúdo específico que está sendo desenvolvido para o site, portanto, certifique-se de que suas habilidades de escrita sejam excelentes para trabalhos de SEO.

&#x200B;

5. Curiosidade e Adaptabilidade

O Google muda seus algoritmos de como classifica os resultados dos mecanismos de pesquisa constantemente. Isso pode ser frustrante ou emocionante para você, dependendo da sua perspectiva – mas um bom [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/) aceita esse desafio com entusiasmo.

&#x200B;

Você precisará ser ágil para prosperar no espaço de SEO. Muitos profissionais se beneficiariam do aprendizado contínuo, mas um especialista em SEO precisa disso para sobreviver. Além disso, se você é responsável pelo site de uma única empresa, não pode se dar ao luxo de ser complacente - como especialista em SEO, é seu trabalho revisar constantemente seu conteúdo para ver se ele está alinhado com as melhores práticas de SEO em constante mudança. .

&#x200B;

Quais são algumas descrições de trabalho relacionadas ao especialista em SEO?

A seguir estão as descrições de cargos comuns que estão próximas do Especialista em SEO:

&#x200B;

Comerciante de mecanismo de pesquisa

O marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa é muito mais amplo e realmente incorpora SEO. O marketing de mecanismo de pesquisa exige que você domine habilidades, incluindo marketing Pay Per Click (PPC), publicidade e algum gerenciamento de relacionamento com o cliente, pois você terá que trabalhar para comercializar para os consumidores e também para os mecanismos de pesquisa. Embora os profissionais de marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa se especializem apenas em pesquisa paga, alguns lidam com marketing de mecanismo de pesquisa e SEO. Dominar a pesquisa de palavras-chave e ferramentas de SEO como Google AdWords, Bing AdWords e Google Analytics é um pré-requisito.

&#x200B;

Consultor de Marketing Empresarial

&#x200B;

Os profissionais de marketing digital geralmente lidam com todos os tipos de marketing on-line, incluindo SEO, SEM, PPC e mídia social. Os profissionais de marketing digital criam e executam estratégias de marketing, trabalham para impulsionar o SEO, gerenciar conteúdo e usar as mídias sociais com a máxima eficácia para direcionar o tráfego, o reconhecimento da marca e as vendas.

&#x200B;

O e-mail continua sendo um dos métodos mais fortes de atingir um público-alvo comprometido. O marketing por e-mail é principalmente uma atividade geradora de leads, portanto, esses esforços de e-mail sempre fariam parte de uma estratégia de marketing maior.

&#x200B;

Com quem os especialistas em SEO trabalham?

A maioria dos especialistas em SEO trabalharia diretamente como parte de uma equipe maior de marketing ou marketing digital, para trabalhar com equipes de marketing de mídia social, profissionais de marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa e equipes de marketing por e-mail.

&#x200B;

Mas, de forma mais ampla, o SEO afeta praticamente todas as partes do site de uma empresa, o que significa que afeta praticamente todas as partes de uma empresa. Como resultado, um especialista em SEO pode esperar trabalhar com equipes de desenvolvimento, design, vendas, TI e atendimento ao cliente, entre outros.

&#x200B;

Razões para se tornar um especialista em SEO

Existem muitas razões convincentes para considerar uma carreira como especialista em SEO, uma vez que é um campo de rápido crescimento com aplicações para muitos outros domínios do marketing digital e espaços de comunicação. Aqui estão algumas razões pelas quais você pode considerar se tornar um especialista em SEO:

&#x200B;

1. Você tem jeito com as palavras

Às vezes esquecemos que escrever bem é a base do SEO. Um especialista em SEO precisará saber escrever de forma clara e concisa enquanto cria conteúdo focado na intenção do usuário. Além disso, os criadores de palavras podem gostar de ver como pequenos ajustes nas escolhas e na estrutura das palavras, com base na pesquisa de palavras-chave, resultarão no aumento do seu SEO. Comunicar-se com pessoas e mecanismos de pesquisa ao mesmo tempo enquanto cria conteúdo que será considerado atraente para ambos não é uma tarefa fácil, portanto, as habilidades de escrita o levarão muito longe.

&#x200B;

2. Poucos campos são tão dinâmicos

Se você é do tipo com uma sede interminável por informações – e uma apreciação por todas as coisas digitais – uma carreira em SEO seria uma boa opção. Um especialista em SEO sabe que estudar constantemente as revisões do algoritmo do Google e ajustá-las de acordo é uma parte fundamental para direcionar o tráfego do mecanismo de pesquisa e permanecer eficaz como especialista em SEO. Um especialista em SEO precisa ficar atento, pois você nunca sabe quais mudanças podem estar chegando. Se isso é empolgante para você, então um trabalho em SEO seria uma ótima opção.

&#x200B;

3. Forte segurança no emprego

As empresas só recentemente caíram em si para investir mais em otimização de mecanismos de pesquisa e marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa. De acordo com um relatório recente, as empresas que gastam mais de US $ 25.000 por ano em marketing relataram que o marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa e SEO forneceram o melhor retorno sobre o investimento, e dois terços listaram SEM e SEO como uma prioridade extremamente alta ou prioridade muito alta no futuro. do que e-mail marketing ou marketing de mídia social. As empresas já estão direcionando mais dinheiro para o marketing digital do que nunca – como o SEO ocupa uma parte maior desse bolo e continua a fornecer mais valor, deve levar a mais empregos para pessoas com um conjunto de habilidades de SEO.

&#x200B;

4. Raspe sua coceira de design

Um bom especialista em SEO nunca considera SEO no vácuo. Um especialista em SEO deve levar em consideração a totalidade do site de um cliente ou empresa e levar em consideração não apenas a estrutura, mas também a experiência do usuário e a aparência geral. Portanto, o trabalho de um [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/) não envolve apenas escrever conteúdo atraente, ele também precisa saber como exercitar seu olhar para a estética e o design da web. Não há muitos trabalhos que permitiriam que você flexionasse tantos músculos criativos como faria como um especialista em SEO, e essa é uma perspectiva atraente para muitos.

&#x200B;

5. As habilidades de SEO são transferíveis

Depois de ter uma habilidade de SEO definida e dominar as ferramentas de SEO, você será um candidato atraente para vários outros empregos em diferentes setores e empresas. Dê uma olhada em uma descrição de trabalho não [especialista em SEO](https://www.abrantesseo.com/) e você ainda provavelmente encontrará a experiência em SEO um acessório de empregos em áreas como comunicação, gerenciamento de conteúdo, marketing, mídia social e jornalismo.

As we all know over the course of this pandemic so much as changed, including how we (and why we) run our ads. So much of my data has to be analyzed taking into account the weird ""post"" pandemic ""outlier"" data. It got me thinking that techniques for running effective paid ad probably has changed too. 

Looking for recommendations for ""refresher"" or intermediate level courses to take on how to effectively build ppc and social paid campaigns. Would love a course that cover SEO as well. 

I already have a BBA as well as 5 years of work experience to give some insights. I don't think a ""beginner course"" would be of much use (Most courses I've come across seem to be ""entry level""). Although I'm open to a ""beginner"" course if it's been instrumental in your growth as a marketer. Also looking to prepare for a management position. I also got my Facebook Blueprint a few years ago but never renewed it. 

&#x200B;

So far I've looked into: 

* Google Digital Marketing Certifications on [Coursera.org](https://Coursera.org) 
   * (i.e.[https://www.coursera.org/learn/assess-for-success](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assess-for-success))

231,158,qgovuk,brainstation,"Vancouver Web Development Bootcamps (General Assembly, BrainStation, Lighthouse Labs, CodeCore) Help",vancouver,bahamet7,2021-10-27 0:54,27,"Hello,

I have been contemplating for a long time to transition into Web Development and was going to start once I decide on a bootcamp. 

I have done enough research to understand that bootcamps grads are not the most sought after but don't really have any other methods to transition (I cannot go to BCIT/SFU/UBC as the time to redo all the requirements will take an extremely long time before I can get into a program, which is not guaranteed as it is competitive + cost). I just hope my high drive and ambition will offset it. I plan to work hard.

Knowing this, I have come to the conclusion I will most likely need to attend a bootcamp. Here is what I found:

|Company|Time Commitment|Cost|Syllabus|Company Site|Other|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|General Assembly|480hrs (8hrs/day) for 12 weeks|$13,950|[Link](https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/production/uploads/program/course_catalog/11342/SEI_Syllabi_062920.pdf)|[Link](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/vancouver)|14hr prep course|
|Brainstation|489hrs (8.25hrs/day) for 12 weeks|$15,000|[Link](https://brainstation.io/course-package/web-development-immersive/vancouver?showSetPassword=true)|[Link](https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp)|14hr prep course|
|Lighthouse Labs|720hrs (12hrs/day) for 12 weeks|$13,000|[Link](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/pdf/web-development-bootcamp-curriculum.pdf)|[Link](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp)|70hr prep course|
|CodeCore|360hrs (6hrs/day) for 12 weeks|$12,700|N/A|[Link](https://codecore.ca/programs/bootcamp-co-op/)|360hrs (6hrs/day) coop for 12 weeks, no prep course|

After all the research, I basically have a few questions for people that are in/recently graduated from a bootcamp. The latest post about bootcamps in Vancouver is 7-11 months ago. I was hoping to know if anyone had gone through any of these more recently. I always only hear about Lighthouse Labs and that's pretty much it. Also if anyone has any input on their career/job placement services after the program it would mean a lot to me (as that seems the most important next to content). All these websites and online research suggest they are all good, but it is hard to distinguish which one is may be the best choice as I assume the reviews are usually biased in some way. It would be awesome to hear from grads about all 4 schools. I plan to self study for about 2 months before applying to one (as they recommend applying 4-8 weeks ahead) and was also wondering what kind of interview questions are usually asked in the application process. Also outside of the bootcamp, if you found a mentor, how did you find one?

For people with some experience, here are some additional questions. What kind of pay can you expect as a Junior Dev after a bootcamp (seems to be 40k-60k)? Is it different than if you graduated from BCIT/SFU/UBC? Is the demand still there for FE/BE/Full Stack developers or is it dying down? If any experienced person could even check out the links and see which curriculum from which school may be covering the most relevant and useful topics, that would also be appreciated.

Thank you and I hope you have a wonderful day!

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your advice. It looks like paying for a bootcamp may not be considered the best option (I mean there is some positive sentiment but mostly self learning and being involved in good projects seems to be the way to go) if you can be motivated enough to self learn. I will just look for work as I am currently unemployed and give it my all in learning for the next year. Hopefully I can find work but sadly it isn't easy to find work in my field (especially being so close to the holidays). Bootcamps are something I can choose to revisit in the future if I really need the structure or have use for the career services all of them seem to be providing. I hope you all have a great day and once again thank you (I will come back consistently for the links and advice you gave me)!

Update: Please see my updated post. I know I wrote about that I wouldn't be taking a bootcamp but as I continued studying, I knew I wouldn't be able to do it alone. I eventually did more research and ended up going to LHL. You can see my bootcamp experience and how I got employed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/uhrf3r/vancouver_web_development_bootcamp_update/)."

Please advise😅,ontario,Ok-Confection7096,2022-05-31 0:00,2,"Story: I work full time as a pharm tech in GTA, ON and I do a pretty good job. I have been a people person all along and I genuinely like taking care of peoples health. I’ve had family members and distant relatives pass away due to medical errors back home, so healthcare is very personal to me and I have really high standards for myself. I constantly educate people on how to maintain good health and look for unusual signs because I feel as if now it’s my responsibility to save lives of people that I know. I strive to be the best I can but the career honestly doesn’t really pay as well. I did a Pharm Tech Diploma and now make 50k a year so you get what you pay for and I know it can’t go any further. 

I’ve worked nonstop since the pandemic which is why now I’m completely burnt out & reached career stagnancy.  It’s hard to keep caring at the same level because I’m way past point of exhaustion- physical and mental. There is a fixed 2% annual raise which is a joke. Yearly Christmas party isn’t doing it either. Also, I am 29 y/o and can’t quit my job completely if I choose to study because of ongoing bills. I have been googling stuff about different streams in IT like Data Science, Web Development, Software, etc. & watching YT videos like ‘a day in life of an analyst/programmer’ for a little overview. 
Self-taught route seems very daunting although I am aware based on my research that it will be mostly self-learning no matter which route I take. Can’t afford a Full-time Brainstation/ Lighthouse Labs/ UofT boot camp so I’ve decided to trade time for money & enrol in a college diploma because of OSAP. I have applied for Fall 2022 to 

1) Centennial- Business Analytics 
2) Centennial- Software Engineering Technician
3) Seneca- Computer Programming 
4) George Brown- Health Informatics 
5) Algonquin- Computer Programming online 

Hoping to get some feedback about what’s more practical? Self study, boot camp or a diploma considering the time frame for each option? I am aware about the importance of Co-ops in these programs. Also considering that college profs may not be up to par and make a two year program feel like a long nightmare. It’s all a bit overwhelming and causes a bit of anxiety when I think too hard because I can’t make a decision. 

Self-teaching:   I am also considering to cut work hours beforehand and taking some online courses in every field like intro to Python, intro to Data Analysis, etc. before the actual college begins- so I have an idea if it’s even worth doing a couple years if I don’t like a particular field I’ve applied to. 
So far it’s all what-if’s and how-to’s. Hoping to get some insight from people in the field/ perusing education about 
- path of least resistance/ better suit as a second career/ relatively easier to break into ?
- self-guided/ Bootcamps/ Diploma? 
- Any decent colleges for Diploma in GTA?"

A little bit about myself: I’m 31 and have a degree in Psychology/Clinical training and 3 years of clinical practice. However, I immigrated to Canada where the requirements to be a psychologist are quite different than from my home country (in other words: my clinical training and practice is worth nothing here, I was only able to validade my Bachelor’s degree). I didn’t have time/money to invest on another 6 years of masters + PhD (I already spent 8 years in University so I wanted to avoid going back), so I had to reinvent myself and find other career options.

I was lucky enough to land a job in multilingual costumer support for a big tech company. One year later, I was able to learn enough tech skills to move into a Technical Support for marketing products. My job is to troubleshoot escalated issues, help both customers and internal stakeholders, work closely with developers and product teams, create training and documentation, etc…i have been doing this for 2 years now.

However, I’m not happy where I am and want to find a career I actually enjoy/feel proud of. I self taught how to code a bit and considered pursing a career in software development, but I honestly miss dealing with psychology themes. I’m quite passionate about human behaviour and I love writing, so I’m not sure I’d be happy as a developer. After lots of browsing/searching/thinking, I decided to look into UX Design!

I started a few courses (Codeacademy, Google’s UX Design course) and even setup a few meeting/shadowing sessions with product designers from my company. I am enjoying it a lot and think its a field that would allow me to build upon my existing skills and experience, instead of starting over.

But now I can’t decide on the next step: I need a more structured course to allow me to dive into deeper and build a portofolio. I am between the following courses:

1.	⁠1 year Graduate Certificate from a College: interdisciplinary Studies in Human Centered Design (one term of co-op)
2.	⁠2 year diploma in Interactive Media Design (co—op as well)
3.	⁠Either DesignLab or Brainstation UX bootcamp.

Based on your experience and my profile, do you have any advise for me to move forward? I am really struggling to decide which would be the best investment for me."

I am seriously considering a change of career since I feel that I am stock in my current line of work (Sales), I studied Electronic engineering 15 years ago, but I never really got into it for different life situations, anyway I always was interested in the coding part of my degree and I feel that now is the time.

I am 37 years old, so I don't want to spend 5 years in a University to get a new diploma, I am interested in the practical part of it, so I found out there are boot camps for coding, which is pretty much what I am looking for.

My question would be, since they are not cheap, $15K here in Canada, if it is actually worth the money, would it give me the tools and the knowledge to get a decent job in the field and the opportunity to grow in the future in this field, and if so what would you be your recommendation in schools, I've been doing my research and so far BrainStation is at the top of my list.

A maioria dos especialistas em SEO que trabalham na área buscam algum tipo de certificação adicional para mostrar aos empregadores que eles têm as habilidades específicas necessárias para executar sua estratégia de marketing digital, aumentar o tráfego de mecanismos de pesquisa e garantir que seu site esteja próximo do topo nas páginas de resultados dos mecanismos de pesquisa.

Mesmo que você tenha um diploma relevante, o aprimoramento com um curso de certificação ou outro curso on-line provavelmente será necessário para provar que você está no topo do mundo em constante mudança do SEO.

## Características de um especialista em SEO de sucesso?

Aqui estão algumas das principais características que os especialistas em SEO bem-sucedidos devem ter para prosperar no mundo do marketing digital e da otimização de mecanismos de busca:

1. Uma compreensão dos três níveis de SEO, Existem três níveis para otimização de mecanismos de pesquisa e qualquer bom especialista em SEO deve manter todos os três em mente ao desenvolver uma estratégia de marketing:

Técnico refere-se aos elementos sem conteúdo do seu site. Esta seção inclui estratégias para melhorar a estrutura de back-end e a base de um site. Parte deste trabalho envolverá a realização de uma análise completa do site, que pode descobrir oportunidades para SEO técnico para melhorar a velocidade do site, indexação, compatibilidade com dispositivos móveis, rastreabilidade e arquitetura do site. O SEO técnico também melhorará crucialmente a legibilidade de um site, o que, por sua vez, melhora a experiência do usuário e mostra aos mecanismos de pesquisa que o site é bom.O SEO na página está relacionado ao conteúdo do seu site e sua otimização para ajudar os mecanismos de pesquisa a entender o tópico do seu conteúdo e ver o site como um recurso valioso. O SEO na página inclui o uso de elementos como palavras-chave, meta tags, links internos e tags de título HTML de forma a ajudar a aumentar o tráfego do mecanismo de pesquisa e garantir que ele esteja próximo ao topo dos resultados do Google.A otimização fora da página trata da criação de um relacionamento mais forte entre seu site e outros sites por meio de uma variedade de táticas de criação de links. A otimização fora da página também inclui estratégias para construir a reputação de um site para mostrar aos mecanismos de pesquisa que um site é uma fonte confiável e, portanto, deve ser posicionado próximo ao topo das classificações dos mecanismos de pesquisa.Os especialistas em SEO precisam saber como todos os níveis de otimização de mecanismos de pesquisa contribuem para o destaque do seu site entre os resultados de pesquisa do Google.

2. Uma mente experiente para marketing Os aspectos técnicos do SEO são obviamente uma grande parte do trabalho, e entender os problemas que podem estar fazendo com que o Google enterre seu site nos resultados da pesquisa é crucial. Mas uma vez que você supera isso, os trabalhos na indústria de SEO tendem a ter muito em comum com outros trabalhos de marketing digital ou mesmo de marketing tradicional: em última análise, você precisa criar e posicionar o conteúdo para que ele descreva o benefício do consumidor enquanto cutuca aproximando-os de uma venda.

A parte complicada é criar conteúdo que seja atraente tanto para as pessoas do outro lado do mecanismo de pesquisa quanto para agradar um algoritmo do Google. Isso vem com a experiência.

Mas a experiência em SEO necessária para realmente se conectar como especialista em SEO e profissional de marketing digital de forma mais ampla é mais profunda do que isso. Para realmente ter sucesso em uma função de SEO, você deve sempre considerar o marketing de conteúdo em um nível mais profundo, bem como a psicologia do consumidor e o público-alvo para quem você está comercializando, o cenário de mídia social, design e desenvolvimento da web, estratégias de marketing viral, e metas gerais de negócios que ajudam a aumentar o reconhecimento da marca e as conversões.

3. Uma capacidade de pensar em grande escala Como estabelecemos, SEO toca tudo. E os sites das empresas são tão importantes que o SEO não pode ser desconectado do restante dessas considerações.

Isso ajuda a ter objetivos específicos em torno de campanhas de SEO. Como especialista em SEO, seu objetivo é se concentrar nos rankings dos mecanismos de pesquisa, direcionar tráfego, aumentar o reconhecimento da marca ou conversões (transformar alguém que visita seu site em um cliente)?

Definir esses objetivos e, em seguida, ser capaz de manter os objetivos maiores da organização em mente enquanto executa uma estratégia de SEO preparará um especialista em SEO para o sucesso.

4. Habilidades de comunicação de alto nível e espírito colaborativo Um especialista em SEO trabalhará com uma ampla variedade de departamentos em uma empresa, incluindo vendas, atendimento ao cliente, desenvolvimento web, análise, TI, marketing e muito mais. E nem sempre é fácil explicar por que fazer alterações em um site aumentará o SEO e resultará em mais tráfego e conversões. É aí que suas habilidades de comunicação entram em jogo.

Especialistas em SEO precisam saber explicar de forma persuasiva e acessível por que certas mudanças são necessárias e como elas beneficiarão o site e os resultados da empresa. Além disso, parte do seu trabalho é poder fazer isso com equipes de diferentes origens e perspectivas no site.

Não apenas isso, mas você pode estar envolvido no conteúdo específico que está sendo desenvolvido para o site, portanto, certifique-se de que suas habilidades de escrita sejam excelentes para trabalhos de SEO.

5. Curiosidade e AdaptabilidadeO Google muda seus algoritmos de como classifica os resultados dos mecanismos de pesquisa constantemente. Isso pode ser frustrante ou empolgante para você, dependendo da sua perspectiva – mas um bom especialista em SEO aceita esse desafio com entusiasmo.

Você precisará ser ágil para prosperar no espaço de SEO. Muitos profissionais se beneficiariam do aprendizado contínuo, mas um especialista em SEO precisa disso para sobreviver. Além disso, se você é responsável pelo site de uma única empresa, não pode se dar ao luxo de ser complacente – como especialista em SEO, é seu trabalho revisar constantemente seu conteúdo para ver se ele está alinhado com as melhores práticas de SEO em constante mudança. .

Quais são algumas descrições de trabalho relacionadas ao especialista em SEO?A seguir estão as descrições de cargos comuns que estão próximas do Especialista em SEO:

Comerciante de mecanismo de pesquisa Muitas vezes, a otimização do mecanismo de pesquisa e o marketing do mecanismo de pesquisa (SEM) são agrupados, mas, na realidade, são muito diferentes. O marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa é muito mais amplo e realmente incorpora SEO. O marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa exige que você domine habilidades, incluindo marketing Pay Per Click (PPC), publicidade e algum gerenciamento de relacionamento com o cliente, pois você terá que trabalhar para comercializar para os consumidores e também para os mecanismos de pesquisa. Embora os profissionais de marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa se especializem apenas em pesquisa paga, alguns lidam com marketing de mecanismo de pesquisa e SEO. Dominar a pesquisa de palavras-chave e ferramentas de SEO como Google AdWords, Bing AdWords e Google Analytics é um pré-requisito.

Consultor de Marketing Empresarial Profissionais de SEO têm uma visão que está em alta demanda. Você precisará demonstrar um histórico comprovado de sucesso relacionado a SEO para se qualificar para um emprego como Consultor de Marketing de Negócios, pois essa posição exigiria que você trabalhasse com clientes para fornecer soluções para suas necessidades específicas, planejar e ajudar na implementação SEO e outras iniciativas de marketing, medem a eficácia das estratégias de marketing existentes, bem como aquelas que você coloca em prática, e fornecem suporte e estratégia de longo prazo para criar valor para essas empresas.

Gerente de Marketing DigitalOs mundos do marketing digital e SEO estão intrinsecamente ligados. Os profissionais de marketing digital geralmente lidam com todos os tipos de marketing on-line, incluindo SEO, SEM, PPC e mídia social. Os profissionais de marketing digital criam e executam estratégias de marketing, trabalham para impulsionar o SEO, gerenciar conteúdo e usar as mídias sociais com a máxima eficácia para direcionar o tráfego, o reconhecimento da marca e as vendas.

Gerente de mídia socialA descrição do trabalho de um gerente de mídia social exige a criação de conteúdo de mídia social atraente que funcione em todas as plataformas de mídia social e seja publicado nos momentos certos e nos formatos certos para causar o maior impacto possível com o público-alvo de uma empresa. Como um especialista em SEO, parte da responsabilidade de um gerente de mídia social é direcionar o tráfego para o site de uma empresa enquanto também interage diretamente com consumidores e usuários por meio de suas contas de mídia social.

Especialista em E-mail Marketing Mergulhando em um nicho mais profundo no marketing digital, os especialistas em marketing por e-mail sabem exatamente como criar conteúdo atraente para campanhas de e-mail que atrairão os clientes a clicar. O e-mail continua sendo um dos métodos mais fortes de atingir um público-alvo comprometido. O marketing por e-mail é principalmente uma atividade geradora de leads, portanto, esses esforços de e-mail sempre fariam parte de uma estratégia de marketing maior.

Com quem os especialistas em SEO trabalham? A maioria dos especialistas em SEO trabalharia diretamente como parte de uma equipe maior de marketing ou marketing digital, para trabalhar com equipes de marketing de mídia social, profissionais de marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa e equipes de marketing por e-mail.

Mas, de forma mais ampla, o SEO afeta praticamente todas as partes do site de uma empresa, o que significa que afeta praticamente todas as partes de uma empresa. Como resultado, um especialista em SEO pode esperar trabalhar com equipes de desenvolvimento, design, vendas, TI e atendimento ao cliente, entre outros.

Razões para se tornar um especialista em SEO Existem muitas razões convincentes para considerar uma carreira como especialista em SEO, uma vez que é um campo de rápido crescimento com aplicações para muitos outros domínios do marketing digital e espaços de comunicação. Aqui estão algumas razões pelas quais você pode considerar se tornar um especialista em SEO:

1. Você tem jeito com as palavras Às vezes esquecemos que escrever bem é a base do SEO. Um especialista em SEO precisará saber escrever de forma clara e concisa enquanto cria conteúdo focado na intenção do usuário. Além disso, os criadores de palavras podem gostar de ver como pequenos ajustes nas escolhas e na estrutura das palavras, com base na pesquisa de palavras-chave, resultarão no aumento do seu SEO. Comunicar-se com pessoas e mecanismos de pesquisa ao mesmo tempo enquanto cria conteúdo que será considerado atraente para ambos não é uma tarefa fácil, portanto, as habilidades de escrita o levarão muito longe.
2. Poucos campos são tão dinâmicos, Se você é do tipo com uma sede interminável por informações – e uma apreciação por todas as coisas digitais – uma carreira em SEO seria uma boa opção. Um especialista em SEO sabe que estudar constantemente as revisões do algoritmo do Google e ajustá-las de acordo é uma parte fundamental para direcionar o tráfego do mecanismo de pesquisa e permanecer eficaz como especialista em SEO. Um especialista em SEO precisa ficar atento, pois você nunca sabe quais mudanças podem estar chegando. Se isso é empolgante para você, então um trabalho em SEO seria uma ótima opção.
3. Forte segurança no emprego, As empresas só recentemente voltaram a si para investir mais em otimização de mecanismos de pesquisa e marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa. De acordo com um relatório recente, as empresas que gastam mais de US $ 25.000 por ano em marketing relataram que o marketing de mecanismos de pesquisa e SEO forneceram o melhor retorno sobre o investimento, e dois terços listaram SEM e SEO como uma prioridade extremamente alta ou muito alta no futuro – mais ainda do que e-mail marketing ou marketing de mídia social. As empresas já estão direcionando mais dinheiro para o marketing digital do que nunca – como o SEO ocupa uma parte maior desse bolo e continua a fornecer mais valor, deve levar a mais empregos para pessoas com um conjunto de habilidades de SEO.
4. Experiêcia do usuário, Design. Um especialista em SEO deve levar em consideração a totalidade do site de um cliente ou empresa e levar em consideração não apenas a estrutura, mas também a experiência do usuário e a aparência geral. Portanto, o trabalho de um especialista em SEO não envolve apenas escrever conteúdo atraente, eles também precisam saber como exercitar seu olho para a estética e o design da web. Não há muitos empregos que permitiriam que você flexionasse tantos músculos criativos como faria como um especialista em SEO, e essa é uma perspectiva atraente para muitos.
5. As habilidades de SEO são transferíveisDepois de ter uma habilidade de SEO definida e dominar as ferramentas de SEO, você será um candidato atraente para vários outros empregos em diferentes setores e empresas. Dê uma olhada em uma descrição de trabalho não especialista em SEO e você ainda provavelmente encontrará a experiência em SEO um acessório de empregos em áreas como comunicação, gerenciamento de conteúdo, marketing, mídia social e jornalismo.

238,165,vbuajh,brainstation,Advice for someone with a Psychology degree going into UX Design/Research?,careerguidance,squidwardtheexplorer,2022-06-13 23:39,7,"Hi! I am currently doing my undergrad in psychology and had always planned to work as a Mental Health professional. But I'm realizing that maybe academia is not for me and I'm way too burnt out to go through with it.

I was always interested in design so I started looking into UX design/research. I'm considering doing a UX bootcamp either during the summer or post grad but I would like to know some things before I commit myself to it.

With the current plan that I have (BSc. in Psych + UX bootcamp) what would my prospects in the field look like? I am under the assumption that going into UX research with just a psych degree might make it still quite difficult to find jobs even with research experience. I do genuinely find the design aspect of UX interesting as well so I am not against teaching myself the skills at all if it helps me (hence the bootcamp). I also always hear about how the field is oversaturated. How would that affect someone with my (potential) skillset?

I'd also like to hear your opinions on which bootcamps I should go for if I do decided to do one. For bootcamps I've been considering an in-person one offered in Toronto by Brainstation. I still need to do more research on it but it seems to be a good choice for networking purposes but I don't know if it'll truly make that big of a difference from online ones and that's something I need to take into consideration because I don't live in Toronto and I would have to move if I decide to go through with it (my post grad plans have always loosely involved moving to Toronto so this isn't too crazy of a plan for me lol). I've also heard that the google coursera UX course is also good for an online choice.

And just any general advice and realistic notes that I should consider before going into this field would be helpful!

Note: I still want to pursue mental health work and decided that if I go through with UX/UI, mental health is a field I would like to contribute towards on the side as a passion project. "

240,167,uw3qm3,brainstation,Low Cost MBA in Business Analytics from Sprott School of Business?,careeradvice,reddletomp,2022-05-23 12:09,2,"Hi there, I was wondering if I could get some guidance on whether to pursue an MBA program at Carleton University (Sprott School of Business) or take a Data Science boot camp through an online company called Brainstation.io.

A bit about myself:

\- I’m 31 years old  
\- Married and planning to have kids within 3 years  
\- I did my undergrad in Human Biology in Neuroscience and Psychology with a minor in Professional Writing at UofT (it’s been pretty much useless in the workforce)  
\- I co-founded and scaled mobile app company from a local Toronto start up to operating across North America  
\- I’ve been running this company for 5 years and looking to re-enter the job market  
\- Mainly I was responsible for the Operations side of the business and would most likely have a skill set of an Operations Manager if I worked at another larger company.  
\- I’m trying to keep my costs low if I can.  
\- I feel that I need to get some sort of technical skill.

Currently, I’m looking to re-enter the workforce. I feel like for my experience with running my own company to be taken more seriously and for me to earn more I’d need to couple my experience/skills set with some type of further education. I also feel that because I’m planning to start a family within 3 years pursuing further education afterwards may be more challenging so it makes more sense to start now. The reason I looked at Carleton’s MBA program was because it was low cost ($13k) and online so I can work while still pursuing the MBA. I also found that I have an interest and skills that would be suited in data/business analytics as well as management. The Sprott School of Business offers a concentration in analytics so that’s another reason why I like it. I understand Carleton (Sprott School of Business) doesn’t have the name recognition as Rotman or Schulich but I think it’s reasonable to assume that having an MBA could provide my job market value a 13k immediate bump which means the cost of the program pays for itself within a year.

Additionally, I’m thinking of coupling this with a PMP within the 3 years as well to further maximize my value.

Alternatively, I was looking at a Data Science boot camp offered by Brainstation for $15k. This is because they offer a relatively short program and I enjoyed analytics portion of running my own business. Also, it seems like it would provide me with some sort of technical skill that I can use in the workforce.

Would you recommend pursuing the MBA education based on the information I provided to help my career path? Or is it better to complete the data science bootcamp?"

My son, who is a professor of Chemistry, has noticed that Chinese and Indian grad students have difficulty 'thinking out of the box'.. Is there a 'curiosity quotient' that might capture that charactoristic?"

As we all know over the course of this pandemic so much as changed, including how we (and why we) run our ads. So much of my data has to be analyzed taking into account the weird ""post"" pandemic ""outlier"" data. It got me thinking that techniques for running effective paid ad probably has changed too.

Looking for recommendations for ""refresher"" or intermediate level courses to take on how to effectively build ppc and social paid campaigns. Would love a course that cover SEO as well.

I already have a BBA as well as 5 years of work experience to give some insights. I don't think a ""beginner course"" would be of much use (Most courses I've come across seem to be ""entry level""). Although I'm open to a ""beginner"" course if it's been instrumental in your growth as a marketer. Also looking to prepare for a management position. I also got my Facebook Blueprint a few years ago but never renewed it.

So far I've looked into:

* Google Digital Marketing Certifications on [Coursera.org](https://coursera.org/)  

   * (i.e.[https://www.coursera.org/learn/assess-for-success](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assess-for-success))

Being a great graphic designer is about more than just being an artist. Graphic design is the ultimate marriage of art **and** technology to create functional designs. If you want to be a graphic designer, you need to have knowledge of design software and technology. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Photoshop are the most frequently used design programs. You’ll also need to understand the basic principles of design. A graphic designer needs to know how to work with color, lines, shapes, and typography. Being able to create a balance of these elements is crucial to creating designs that are visually appealing. 

* The list of jobs you can get in the graphic design field include: logo design, game art design, UI and UX design, streamers, storyboard artistry, web and mobile design, wireframes design, social media design, postcard design, catalog design, menu design, business product design, invitation design, portrait design, cartoon concept art and design, caricature drawing, comics and graphic novels, and business card design.

Writing is simply another form of communication. Therefore, you must be able to communicate your ideas effectively to be a good writer. You also need to be adaptable and disciplined in the field of writing. Adaptability allows you to be able to write about any topic you need to. Discipline is important for you to be able to finish writing an article on time without distraction. A good writer needs to know how to research their topic, and edit out what they don’t need. Being well versed on what you’re writing about will help you to appear professional. 

* The list of jobs you can get in the writing field include: translation, article and news writing, editing and proofreading text, web content creation, industry specific expertise, book writing, research, and copywriting.

In order to get any kind of job in the technical field, you’ll need some basic hard skills. These skills include network configuration, coding, technical writing, and hardware development. A technical job may also require you to have social media skills. You can check with your coach to see which skills you know best and which need improving. A job in the technical field will also require you to have operating system knowledge. While you’ll mostly be working with one type of software, being knowledgeable in different types will increase your hiring  appeal.

Any type of administrative job will require you to be organized. Certain responsibilities of an administrative job will require you to perform tasks like filing papers. Being well organized will help you to perform these tasks to the best of your ability. These kinds of jobs entail being on a team, so good teamwork and communication skills are a must. You also need to prioritize important duties and manage your time to get them all done. 

* The list of jobs you can get in the administrative field include: data entry, Microsoft Office usage, Word processing and typing, personal / virtual assistance, spreadsheet and data manipulation, and customer service.

Business and finance jobs

Having a job in business and/or finance will require you to interact with clients. Therefore, you’ll need to be interpersonal and have the ability to communicate. These days, it’s important to be able to analyze a situation and create solutions. Ergo, you’ll have to be a problem-solver and an innovator as well. 

* The list of jobs you can get in the business and finance field include: junior tax accountant, stockbroker, personal finance advisor, banking assistant, and financial analyst.

Education jobs

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/winpmdhts6p81.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f6c2df6b64b09e4e53df4bd8d220a010cf55feca

To be a teacher or any other kind of educator, you’ll need patience. If a student is disruptive or late, you have to be able to deal with it without losing your cool. A good educator will also be a good **communicator**, making their expectations and feedback clear for their students. Being a teacher means you’ll be leading your students through your educational journey, so you need to be the best leader you can. Leadership is next to teamwork in the educational field. You need to work together with your students, even if you have differing opinions. 

* The list of jobs you can get in the education field include: postsecondary teacher, postsecondary education administrator, curriculum developer, school counselor and special education teacher.

260,187,ucqn7f,brainstation,UX Bootcamps - Whats the difference? Was it worth it?,careerguidance,PLUFFY3,2022-04-26 20:14,1,"Hi Everyone

As title states, I'm considering a transition into UX.

I know this has been asked many times before but most of the posts I've seen are from 2-3 years ago, and I just wanted some fresh input in case things have changed since.

1. I've looked at the course at GA, Flatiron, Brainstation, Springboard, and designlab. I noticed that GA and flatiron cost significantly more (15k+). What is the difference between those courses vs brainstation, springboard or designlab? Do they offer different curriculum or is it in the additional resources that is provided?
2. For anyone else who was in the dilemma, what led you to choose the program you were/is with ?
3. I've heard some youtubers mention that its possible to get into UX without bootcamp by utilizing free courses. For anyone who has tried this, was it worth it? How long did it take for you to learn, build a portfolio and getting a job? Does the bootcamp certificate actually matter or is it really about the portfolio? (I think I def need an instructor because I have negative design experience but I would love to hear from people who were self taught! )
4. For anyone in UX, whats the most difficult part about getting started and even on the job?"

I have been reading lots of posts about UI UX from BCIT.
The programs I got from those readings are these: D3, New Media, and UI UX part time. Here are my findings and please correct if I am wrong.

New Media: You learn everything in a broad spectrum so if you want to be something specific, not the program for you. 

D3: same as New Media but better for people who want to be in design rather than UI UX

Part time: Focused on UI UX but not many people know about it. 

I am leaning toward UI UX part time studies since the courses primarily focuse on UI UX but what do you guys think?

Also did anyone take brainstation for UI or UX and how was it?"

263,190,qmj0ue,brainstation,Career Transition into Data Science in Vancouver,vancouver,goofyco,2021-11-04 8:01,1,"Hi, r/Vancouver subreddit. I believe this is my first time posting here. As the title suggests, I'm interested in transitioning into data science. However, the posts that I've seen about Data Science bootcamps (Lighthouse Labs, Brainstation) being insufficient and the constant mentions of PhDs in the job market make me feel worried about my plans.

A bit of info about myself:

* Obtained a BA and MA in Economics (top 35 universities)
* Participated in Data Science courses (IBM, Google audited) to get a grasp of what's going on.
* Spent most of my time working in a family business that isn't related to data science.
* Read a couple of books on Data Science (Introduction to Statistical Learning)
* Believe I have a basic understanding of Python (along with scikit-learn), R, SQL

Given other posts have somewhat implied that Data Science bootcamps aren't worth the money (\~$13,000), how should I approach this career transition?

* kaggle projects and upload to GitHub to demonstrate my coding proficiency?
* going into a more basic data analyst position first and transitioning from there?
* TensorFlow certificates, or similar certificates?

Looking forward to your responses. All types of feedback are welcome (constructive criticism, general comments on the job market, etc.)

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Felt like I didn't express myself clearly. I'm looking to find a job in Data Science."

The most inconvenient part is that there is no way to unsubscribe. I have to actually talk to a representative and explain why I am not interested, sa I can make them stop calling... and it only works temporarily, after a few months they start messaging me again. It just feels so sketchy and pushy that I am altogether put off by the respective organizations. It happened to me with multiple bootcamps - General Assembly, Brainstation, etc. I understand they want to get me to buy in but honestly, do they really think aggressively forcing their services down my throat will make me magically interested?

*Note 2: The post got so long, it had to be broken down into 2 parts*

As a beginner-level programmer, it's really interesting to know, What it would take to become a programmer/software engineer

There is one question that regularly comes to mind. How could one become a **software engineer**?

The reason the term software engineer is outlined and emphasized as the primary title of getting the one in this post, is probably I like it more than a **software developer,** but not really because of that.

It is important to understand the difference between a **software engineer** and a **software developer.** The most important one is that these are 2 different things

# Software engineer

1. Software Engineer is a professional who applies the principles of software engineering for designing, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software
2. Software Engineer is mainly a team activity
3. Software Engineer tends to solve issues on a much larger scale
4. Software engineer is involved in the complete process of software creation.

Overall software has to be analyzed by reviewing the goals and the requirements, designed, developed, tested, implemented, and maintained. A software engineer works in all stages of the process. The process could be simplified into 1) Analysis -> 2) Design -> 3) Development -> 4) Testing -> 5) Implementation -> 6) Maintenance

5. The average salary for a Software Engineer is $105,861 per year in the United States

# Software developer

1. A software Developer is a professional who builds software that runs across various types of computers
2. Software Developer is primarily a solitary activity
3. Software Developers tend to do everything that engineers do but on a limited scale
4. Development is only one of the aspects of the software project building process.

Most of the time a software developer is focused on the development.

5. The average salary for a Software Developer is $92,380 per year in the United States.

[source 1](https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/software-engineer/) , [source 2](https://www.synapseindia.com/article/6-stages-of-software-development-process)

Moreover, a software engineer cares about the software architecture and design patterns of an application. Code structure would have to make sense in order for the application to run and do the things as It initially was intended to.

By having a solid (but flexible) structure, a software system becomes more manageable and certain fundamental decisions about software architecture would promote the achievement of the tasks that a team or an engineer are facing from the beginning.

# What skills are really needed to learn programming and become a software engineer?

Here is the list of what could be considered a set of ""Hard, technical skills"". It may not be complete

1. **Containers (Docker or/and Kubernetes)** \- a form of operating system virtualization environments. They are used in testing and they also simplify the deployment process

Testing applications in containers requires fewer resources than It is in Virtual machines. It is also easier for applications running in containers to be more portable across multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms

2) **Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)** \- Cloud services are mainly used for the deployment of web applications, testing, big data analytics, cloud storage, and data backup. It can also be used for remote work and outsourcing

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure (Azure) are listed as an example

3) **Version Control Tools (Git and Github)** \- Basically, Git is a version control tool that allows you to manage and keep track of your source code history, versioning, and changes

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service (web service) that lets you manage Git repositories. Github is also a сonvenient place to share and collaborate projects

4) **Text Editors and office tools** \- Look, I know that may sound ridiculous, but along the process, a software engineer sometimes would have a need to make a document that could be presented to people or where to store some simple sketching data.

Microsoft Word - is one of the most used text editors. It could be used to produce documentation and other documents

Microsoft Excel - spreadsheet software that features calculation or computation capabilities for simple pieces of data in the so-called ""cells"".

Seriously, to make good use of it, some additional knowledge would be needed. For Word, It is important to know what headers, table of contents, add-ins, etc. For Excel, knowing basic functions and macros is good

5) **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** \- Most of the time an IDE is a program where the code Itself is written, compiled (with IDE calling the installed interpreter/compiler), debugged, and managed.

Ever used Visual studio for the first time? You may know, how many features and settings are there, and how easy it is to get lost in these without specific knowledge

6) **Database and SQL (SQL based and NoSQL)** \- The computer science community typically outlines 2 types of database systems. They are Relational databases (SQL based) and Non-relational (based on the programming language of a specific database system). These types differ by structure model and scalability

SQL is a classic, it's been around for more than 30 years. It is still, commonly used to this day. There are plenty of SQL Database management systems such as Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, but the SQL language itself varies between different systems and is not always compatible with one another

More recently there have been developed new versions of SQL systems such as **NewSQL** and **Distributed SQL**

NoSQL (Not only SQL) - Non-relational database using key-value pairs and wide-column stores. It is based on a programming language of choice. NoSQL systems were developed largely to address horizontal scalability problems.

In regards to learning these things, I remember **Patrick** **Shyu** (aka ""Techlead"") once said that [SQL usage may provide the ability to do research on particular process](https://youtu.be/3MtrUf81k6c?t=177)[ decisions](https://youtu.be/3MtrUf81k6c?t=177)

7) **UNIX (Linux) -** Linux (UNIX) based OSs right now are probably more popular than ever among Software Engineers, Developers, System Administrators and etc. And for a good set of reasons

Linux allows the user for a more custom-based experience. It grants access to a lot of settings that let the user set up a more personalized environment.

Linux also brings in native support for SSH, which would help you manage your servers quickly

Getting to know Linux, knowing basic commands, (perhaps learning Bash) is a thing to learn

8) **An OOP Low-level Programming language (C\\C++) -** you may or may not know the difference between Low and High-level programming languages.

Low-level languages are by their design closely similar to the language of hardware commands (i,e Assembly, Binary....). They have a minimal abstraction from hardware's native language commands, hence programs are written in a low-level language most often are compiled are run the fastest (except Assembly).

However, these kinds of languages are relatively hard to learn and develop with. It takes usually more time to develop the same software with a low-level language than it is with a High-level language

Someone might say that learning a Low-level language should be industry-specific. It only makes sense if, the industry a certain individual is aiming for, involves the creation of applications with high resource consumption and that there's generally a need for high, real-time computing performance.

Examples of such industries could be I/O programming, OS development, Game development, Compiler Design, Aerospace, Robotics, Malware protection software, High-frequency trading and etc.

Other people could state that It generally makes more sense to learn and build with a High-level programming language if the software does not require intense resource consumption

and They are probably right.

but Hey, wouldn't It be nice If you could learn programming on a more fundamental level before moving on to building applications that are fine to build with High-level languages? Also, maybe putting, let's say C++ experience and applications on your portfolio could get attention?

9) **An OOP High-Level language** \- these languages have more abstraction from the assembly language of hardware, but they are easier to develop with

A high-level language will allow a student to create applications and programs that have a real impact or a purpose, more easily. This is actually important. If there is some idea or a solution that a student would like to implement, that individual will get visible results faster. That means the programmer will be able to move one to something else, quicker. Hence, the person would have more time to do other stuff, learn something new or create another project.

Examples of these languages are pretty known (Python, Java, Javascript, C# ....)

10) **One Scripting language -** a language that will allow writing scripts, simple programs that do a specific task.

These scripts are helpful in work because they provide faster solutions to routine problems. They automate specific operations, which allows saving some time for a software engineer. Examples:

Bash, Python, PHP and etc.

Patrick Shyu also points out that [creating your own tools with scripting has significant positive impact on workflow, productivity and time managment](https://youtu.be/3MtrUf81k6c?t=350)

11) **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** \- knowing proper Data Structures and Algorithms is basically a must because they constitute a core knowledge set of programming.

Part of being proficient in DSA is

knowing and using basic Data Structures like arrays, linked lists, maps, dictionaries, classes, and so on

and

knowing and utilizing Algorithms like loops, recursions, sort, search and etc.

I personally had an impression that, if someone were to start learning Data Structures and Algorithms, they are better to be learned from programming experience. Pick a language, you are most comfortable with and implement Data Structures and Algorithms into simple programs. That way, you can get hands-on experience of coding these things, so that they could be easier replicated by you during the creation of a real application.

12) **Basic programming principles** \- What is it?

Programming principles like **(OOP - Object-Oriented Programming), (Dynamic Programming), (Flow Control Structures), (Socket programming), (Functional Programming), ( Event-driven programming)**, etc.

These principles could be viewed as approaches, paradigms, principles, and so on. They would represent a bigger picture of what Data Structures and Algorithms could present to us. If **DSA** focuses on specific fundamental, units of programming, the paradigms could provide a basis for the architecture of an application.

13) **Networking basics** \- Computer networks is basically a separate branch (field) of Computer Science. Computer Networks as a discipline, studies principles and aspects of communication between computers between each other and ""smart devices"". It focuses on efficient data transfer, from one location to another.

Since many applications (if not the most), use the networks (Local or LAN), and/or (Global or WLAN), knowing how networks are designed and having the ability to work with computer networks is essential

14) **Testing** \- a software engineer along the process would likely be involved in software testing.

Getting experience with Unit Testing, Integration testing, System testing, and learning Selenium framework, HP – UFT, Postman etc. would be a way to start

That includes **penetration testing**

15) **Code review** \- Perhaps this skill may lay on the edge between ""Soft"" and ""Hard"" skills

As it's been mentioned, a software engineer during work will have to go through the whole process of creating applications and software. A software engineer will need to review the code in order to know whether it is appropriate to move to the next stage of the process. (For example: From Development to Testing stage)

What's also interesting about the ability to do code review is that it enhances **debugging** expertise. In this case, the analytical and reasoning skills of code review would not only have a substantial impact on making the code ""Clean"" or ""Efficient"", but also ""Compatible"" and ""Less buggy"".

I'm talking about companies that understands and realizes that we're not experts but we have foundational knowledge and can hack together a project. We are developers who are good at googling shit and finding answers on our own. This doesn't mean we won't ask senior devs for help but usually this will be a last resort after we've exhausted all other resources.

We are the type of devs who knows enough about software engineering where we can discuss all areas across the tech stack. We know that Travis and Jenkins are CI/CD tools and not burger joints. We can explain the difference between Git and Github, what docker is and can intelligently explain what an API is and how to build a basic REST API using an MVC framework.

Are there any companies out there that are willing to hire these type of developers or do they only want Senior devs that has 5-10 years of experience building highly scalable distributed systems or genius CS grads from Waterloo/UofT?

I'm sure this question has been asked in the past, but I'm looking to get a broader opinion. In short, I'm looking to take a coding bootcamp and am having a tough time making a choice. I'm based outside of Toronto, and I've looked at bootcamps within the area, but ultimately I've come down to two BrainStation and General Assembly.

A little background about me, I went to university for Electrical Engineering and have worked as a Project Engineer and Design Engineer since graduating in 2017. For the past few months I've been self-teaching Python and AI (HarvardX AI cert on EdX and a few others on Coursera), but have been looking to move towards Full-Stack. The reason I'm looking into a bootcamp is to better structure my curriculum to be more regimented as I've been mainly exploring the different avenues I could pursue in programming. 

Brainstation covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MySQL (from what I've heard, mostly focused on the front end).

General Assembly covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MongoDB/Python/Django/PostgresSQL (also from what I've heard, more back-end oriented).

I'm looking to get some insight as to whether one bootcamp's stack would better prepare me for the continued self-teaching I'll have to do after the bootcamp. i.e. Would it be better to focus more on front-end with BrainStation as they're heavier in the JS domain? Or would it be better to focus more on the back-end with General Assembly and have a broader familiarization?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I (30M) am thinking about switching my career fields. My current job is mostly about dealing with bureaucratic stuff. It’s a great job and my teammates are really fantastic people, but the nature of the job just does not suit my personality. 

I did study STEM before, but I never worked in tech. I am familiar with most coding concepts, but I’ve never really specialized in anything at all.

277,204,jbgmrh,brainstation,When we sleep or experience other forms of unconciousness why is it not death from a personal identity/Self perspective?,askphilosophy,ExistentialCrisis227,2020-10-15 0:12,100,"I have been struggling with an agonizing existential crisis over the past 4 months and cannot for the life of me resolve it. It was sparked by the ""machine"" comic from Existential comics, and increased by  reading Parfits reasons and persons chapter 3. Particularily sleep is sometjing that concerns me because as I no longer know who I am or under what conditions I persist all I have it phenomenal continuity to cling to, and sleep means that if all I am is a stream of uninterrupted conciousness then I, and all other human beings live a very short life indeed. 

As a result I no longer know who or what I am, Nor under what conditions I persist or survive. Any approach to rely purely on memory fails when viewed through the lense of the teletransporter paradox, or the sleeping pill paradox. Worse still the conditions laid out in the sleeping pill memory loss thought experiment are present for all of us every night when we go to sleep and forget the final few minutes of conciousness creating a branchline similar to the man, soon to be destroyed, knowing his copy that has exited the teletransporter on mars where like your waking self it will continue its life unaware of the ""you"" that spent the final minutes awake unable to transfer over to the next day.

I understand that neolockean views on personal identity dont look purely at mental states but also causal connections, which may well make a decicive  differance why sleep and the teletrasporter are differant.

There is also preservation of a numerically distinct brain/body that survives in sleep un affected and up and running the whole time, while there is only a qualitatively similar brain/body/patter with the teletransporter. This may also make a marked differance. 

At least for me all my intuition scream about the importance of my brain surviving at least. It also seems important that I am not just information like brainstates/a pattern, but that things like causal connections and some kind of physical continuity exists, specifically the brain. Something to survive periods of unconciousness/minor short term memory loss associate with sleep. 

I hope someone here can shed ligjt on my dilema and help explain to me why we dont die every time we fall asleep, or experience some kind of unconciousness. What holds us together so we remain the same person over periods of sleep/unconciousness?"

Instead of going to university in Europe which will cost approximately 40,000 euros for 3 year degree. 1000 per month living expenses and 4000 fees.

Saving this money and doing the University curriculum online for free in mother's house. Then specializing in programming software development (C++, python) and also specializing in full stack engineering in mother's house for free.

Also reading up on communication, leadership, and teamwork for free and then starting out by looking for nonpaid internship online or in person. And then trying to find more opportunities and higher-paying job slowly but surely.

And finally if opportunities are not available considering doing University thing many years into the future while already being a computer scientist with 2 speciality and with work experience.

I Think a skilled engineer without a degree would be able to find 60,000 to 40,000 euro a year salary. The 1st few months will be unpaid low paid internship. If you can prove your skills and have some experience And projects there should be plenty of opportunity.

282,209,o27rfm,brainstation,Portfolio School or Bachelor's Degree?,graphic_design,username_1289,2021-06-17 17:01,2,"Hi everyone!

About me: I graduated from a top business school in Canada in 2018 and am in a job in finance. I have some graphic design experience from university and have done courses here and there at places like Brainstation for UI.

What I want from my career: I want to get out of my finance job and go back to graphic design. Specifically, I would love to go into branding. I want to work either at an in-house agency at a large tech firm and work on visual brand development, or work at a brand consulting agency with clients on developing or changing their brand identities.

My question(s):

1) Since I don't have any formal education in design, would I need to go back to school? To be quite honest, I don't know if I'm ready to go back to school for a 3 year degree in graphic design. I was thinking of Miami Ad School, which has a 2 year portfolio development program. However, it is expensive, and only one year less than a full on Bachelor's degree.

1a) I am leaning towards going to a program in order to keep myself disciplined. I have a full time job right now and it's...a lot. It's in finance and by the time it's 6 pm, i don't have the energy to do anything. Ditto with weekends and having to think about work. Going into some sort of program, whether it be at a college, university, or a for-profit institute would allow me to focus solely on my portfolio.

2) With the work I'm interested in, does it sound like a graphic design role or an art director role? I know some places offer art direction programs but I am not sure if myself, with no professional design experience, would be able to land a role in that field. However, I'm not sure if just focusing on graphic design will lead me to where I want to go in a few years. Additionally, I guess a graphic design role would be more hands on, and after a few years of work, I could EVENTUALLY go into art direction? would love some insight on what I'm expecting from my career is too much for someone just entering the industry.

3) I already have a portfolio, but it's very basic and I haven't updated it in a year. ([www.ruhikokal.com](https://www.ruhikokal.com)) I need to definitely refurbish it and spend more time developing branding case studies but due to issue 1a, I just haven't had the time. I believe going to a program could provide me with the time and dedication to build it."

So far it appears:

""Data Science"" boot camps are typically for people with BS in a STEM field
""Data Analytics"" boot camps are typically for career changes or entry level jobs

I work full time for a tech company and don't have a BA so that eliminates that option.

1. Are there any recommended or industry leading data analytics boot camps?

La vara es que salí de un CTP hace casi 3 años en electrónica en mantenimiento de cómputo. Me ofrecieron quedar de temporal 6 meses como soportista técnico. Le pregunté a mí mamá y al principio me dijo que sí. Ese año; yo había hecho el exámen de admisión de la UCR/UNA por varas. No era de los mejores de mí aula en el CTP y no esperaba una ""buena práctica"". Por buena práctica se entiende que lo dejen temporal, fijo o que le paguen algún viático. 
Yo noté eso por que hice 4 entrevistas cuando usualmente el profesor las asigna y ya está. De esas 4 dos eran procesos que uno podía hacer opcionalmente  ya que son para transnacionales. Sykes y Mckenzie puntualmente. Ninguno los pasé. Me mandaron ha hacer entrevista a una empresa que fabrica pistolas de etiquetas y no pegué. La última que hice fue en una buena empresa, me topé con un muchacho del Voca de info empresarial que quedó de desarrollador de software  por lo que inferí que me dejaron de esas prácticas que eran para la generación de info empresarial que no estaban en ese año eso y que el profe nos comentó que se los malitos teníamos que esperarnos por que el que habla con las empresas en el cole.
Al final quedé de temporal en la buena empresa que les comenté. Me ofrecieron quedarme 6 meses más como soportista técnico con un buen viático y cerca de casa.
Hasta finalea de 2017 siempre fuí un mae que vivía en su propio mundo con malos hábitos de salud. Dibujando y perdiendo el tiempo. Yo perdí tiempo valioso de mí adolescencia viendo anime, telenovelas y subiendo y viendo videos en youtube. Mí meta no era terminar el cole, sino hacerme famoso en youtube para publicar un cómic a mí nombre. No tenía metas serias y me arrepento de no ser como algunos niños que ya saben que hacer con su vida cuando yo no lo hice en su momento ; pero una operación y un cambio de hábitos hizo que sacará lo mejor de mí en 2018. Dejé de comer cosas dulces a menos que fuese en ocadiones especiales 
Como salidas al cine, reuniones familiares entre otros. 
Tomaba más agua, dormía 8 horas, hacía puntualmente  mís tareas y cumplí metas que en el fondo de mí corazon y que una versión anterior a mí no hubiese hecho. Saqué el bachi, peritazgo, me quedé temporal en una empresa con viatico y pasé la admisión de ciertas U públicas. De hecho tenía que hacer un trámite extra para entrar al TEC. No lo digo por rajar, no son cosas indispensables y nada de eso me ha servido; pero es por que ese año fue especial para mí.
Todo se jodió cuando mí mamá me obligó a entrar a la UNA en ingeniería en sistemas a principios de 2019. Aparte que la U queda lejos, mí experiencia con programación no fue la mejor en el CTP . Si me hiba a meter ahí por cuenta propia hubiese estudiado historia o algo así; pero mí mamá me obligó a una carrera de tecnología. Yo le pedí a mí abuela que me diera su aprobación para seguir trabajando por que la casa es de ella , pero se lavó las manos y si no lo decía a mí jefe que abandonaba la pasantía de los seis meses mí mamá le hiba a decir y al final yo quedaba como el mentiroso que no le comentó a sus encargados. 
Mí plan era ganar algo de experiencia en la práctica que me ofrecieron. Para saltar de lugar en lugar más fácil y en ese tramo de tiempo aprender inglés y sacar las certificaciones de  CISCO que me faltaban para meterme en esas cuentas de CISCO de algún call center. 
Al final me pasé a la UNA contra voluntad y es muy incómodo. Pues es el viaje me quita tiempo a la verdad y me clavan mates que me cuestan bastante y  que probablemente no voy a usar a menos que sea analista de datos, o me vaya por IA o ML. Pero me quiero especializar en desarollo web con JS y .NET. Sé que dependiendo del proyecto uno podría ocupar cálculo diferencial y álgebra lineal 
, pero viendo como he visto gente entrando con un técnico medio y revisando el técnico universitario del Cenfotec; cuestionó que esas mates sean indispensables. Es más, un tutor que me ayudó a estudiar y que trabaja en eso ni se acordaba en esa materia y he visto videos de maes que se arrepienten de haber perdido tiempo en la U. 
yo a mí mamá no le quería hacer caso cuando me puso a elegir entre UNA y UCR así que le preguntó a un compañero de trabajo haber cual era mejor y el compañero de trabajo le comentió que la UNA por que disque más general mientras que las carreras de la UCR son más especializadas. (Grandísimo error en mí opinión).
Tras 2 años desde que me pasé a la UNA saqué  la conclusión que debería especializarme en algo por mí cuenta y conseguir brete de una vez, aunque sea de pasante o algo y sin siquiera cobrar por un año. Pero ir aprendiendo en el brete y adaptarme a los cambios del mercado y sacar la U de a poquitos. Ganando experiencia a poquitos y ya después costearme algunas cosas (gimnasio, alimentación,inversiones y ahorrar para  una moto).

El 2020 ha sido uno de los peores años. Si es riquísimo llevar las materias  relacionadas a  progra por ahí, pero las mates son un dolor de muelas. Al menos para mí. Estructuras discretas  me hizo replantearme si en verdad sirvo para la carrera. Mí crush con la que llevaba pulseando medio año se empezó a hechar la miel con otro mae a las dos semanas  y esto de estar  encerrado en casa propicia a que caiga en la masturbación de forma compulsiva.  Encima de eso mís amistades  del CTP siempre se reunen y nunca me invitan a mí y está bien no están obligados; pero igual es triste. Lo bueno es que he intentado dejar esos el vicio de la masturbación, sustituirlo con cocinar, comprar las  cosas de la casa y practicar inglés de manera conversacional, pero las repercusiones acádemicas han sido catastróficas.

Y creo que sí sirvo para desarrollo, pero no para ese campo específico, honestamente. Si me gustaría hacer hiatus por que si estructuras discretas  me fulminó y no lo pasé. No quiero pensar en estructuras de  datos, la verdad me pasaría de U.....

Llegaron las vacaciones y amenaze a mí a mamá con algo delicado si no me dejaba trabajar hable seriamente con mí abuela por que no era justo que no podía costear mís cosas con mí propia plata, pero si tenia que recibir unos míseros 20 rojos mensuales. Accedieron y al final pulsié conseguir trabajo otra vez. El técnico ya no me servia, en todas las ofertas de empleo pedían un mínimo de 1 año de experiencia y aún si lo intentaba rara vez recibía respuesta. Hice cuenta en todas las páginas de bolsas de empleo y aún aplicando temprano con poquitos concursantes aplicando no pegaba nada. No me llamaban. 
Consideré  recoger café, PERO después de mandar mís datos a ICAFE no recibí correo, llamada ni nada. Pregunté por números de  los propietarios de la tierra y nada. Busqué en Facebook y nada. 
Saqué el curso de manipulación de alimentos por que honestamente ocupaba plata y no me importaba trabajar en esos restaurantes con tal tener algo. Digo esto por que toda mí vida en el cole y la familia, me habían dicho que esos eran los peores trabajos. Rellené los datos que solicitaban los restaurantes en sus empresas. Cerca de mi chante hay varios restaurantes y aún aplicando el mismo día, con una media hora de diferencia a restaurantes que llego en menos de 30 minutos a pie o en bus no me pegaba. 
Pulsié en Call Centers, de estos últimos ya no sé que pensar. Aún si en algunos pegaba el +85% de inglés y los maes se hacían los majes. Yo llamaba a los números correspondientes y preguntaban por extensión que no se veían por ningún lado. Mandaba correos a los encargados del proceso y preguntaba por extensiones en sus páginas de facebook y también. 
Pensé que las cosas me hiban salir bien en una tienda de ropa que ocupaban cajero-vendedor y técnico de computación a la vez. Trabajo es trabajo, pero tristemente las ventas no dieron y me liquidaron en el dia 5. Muy agradecido con la oportunidad y la verdad prefiero bretear que quedarme en la casa, jalarmela no ser un hombre  de acción ; la plata que gané me da para pagarme unos cursos en Udemy, pero aparte de Udemy quería pagarme unos cursos de desarrollo web en BrainStation. La verdad es que  Udemy me genera cierta  desconfianza  por que mientras en BrainStation los cursos de desarrollo web salen en 250 rojos cada uno en Udemy salen en unos 6 rojos.  Obvio no lo cuestiono, el gremio de informáticos recomienda youtube y Udemy para aprender y aprendí cosillas en Youtube. 
Mientras hacía todo eso, fuí aprendiendo  HTML, CSS, JS y Git, pero no es sufieciente para empezar en una práctica. 
Por eso quería preguntar a los colegas ¿Cúales cursos de Udemy me recomiendan para aprender BootStrap, React, Angular, Wordpress, NodeJS,AWS y MySQL? 
La misma pregunta sería para el framework MVC o algo así de .NET, supongo que eso se maneja con SQL server y Azure.
La verdad si me gustaría tener lo necesario para entrar en la industria en un año o menos con al menos una de esas 2 tecnologías."

Anyone have recent feedback they can share on the paid Digital Marketing courses on offer? I've seen mixed reviews on the Brain Station, General Assembly but nothing on the U of T Bootcamp (all links below).

Me? I am currently unemployed and applying for [Second Career](https://www.ontario.ca/page/second-career) education funding. I have plenty of experience in the Retail Marketing space. I've assisted with and have knowledge on the key elements of Digital Marketing (Branding, Social Media, SEO, SEM & Google Analytics) but I am far from an expert and have no certificate/diploma.

1. Did a certificate from Brain Station/General Assembly help land you a job?
2. Anyone take the U of T Digital Marketing Bootcamp? I can't find any online reviews specific to this course. Not even sure what you get at the end of this.
3. Any recommendations on the free online classes? I've used Hub Spot Academy. Should I just use these to pad my LinkedIn profile?

299,226,ccs36s,brainstation,"Book promoting scientific\academic racism, cites that Indian IQ lowered from 82 to 76 (2019). Psychologist Lynn and Nyborg promote for cutting all immigration from 3rd World countries. Politics",badscience,None,2019-07-13 13:43,108,"So  the psychologists here are stating that immigration from 3rd world  countries like India should be cut off to save ""white"" civilization. As  black or brown people have low IQ and they are going to ruin their  ""white"" high IQ countries.

[http://www.ulsterinstitute.org/ebook/THE%20INTELLIGENCE%20OF%20NATIONS%20-%20Richard%20Lynn,%20David%20Becker.pdf](http://www.ulsterinstitute.org/ebook/THE%20INTELLIGENCE%20OF%20NATIONS%20-%20Richard%20Lynn,%20David%20Becker.pdf)

[https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html](https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html)

We know that these psychologists have some very questionable results considering that India's HDI, GDP per capita have improved.

Many  people were (either by BJP or Congress) and are still getting lifted  from poverty. We know that the country is better than it was in 1990s.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\_of\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_Human\_Development\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)

Yet  people like Richard Lynn and Becker show that IQ got lowered for some  reason. Becker also posted his study on research gate here-

[https://www.researchgate.net/project/Worlds-IQ](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Worlds-IQ)

You can download his stuff.

Richard  Lynn is known for espousing scientific racism to ""preserve"" or ""save""  the ""white"" civilization. He sympathized with white nationalists and  supremacists. Many white nationalists and academic white nationalists  like Nyborg, Rindermann have promoted such racism against all  countries(which include black and brown population) except far east  asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea.

Not just that, they also lowered Indonesia's IQ from 87 to 78. Ghana's IQ lowered from 64 to 58 holy shit.

REMEMBER,  BELOW IQ 70 IS CONSIDERED INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. A person below IQ 70  cannot pass even 5th or 6th grade. IQ below 80 is considered elementary  school dropout. That is, a person with below IQ 80 will not be able to  drive vehicles.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence\_quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient)

According to Lynn's and Beckers research, an average Indian is nearly intellectually disabled. What the fuck?

AND  DUE TO THIS, these academic racists are promoting stuff like cutting  off immigration from all Brown or African countries.  This is messed up  stuff. They are promoting ""white"" nationalism and that is why I put the  flair of politics here.

These race  ""realists"" are dog whistling actual nazi tactics of sterilization of  black or brown people, promoting discrimination against low IQ people by  promoting statistics where they show correlation between genetics, IQ  and crime.

Basically these psychologists are trying to promote that black and brown people have ""bad"" or ""poor"" genes.

Edit: Found some more data that Lynn didn't use or cite in his new book

[https://raceandiqmyths.blogspot.com/](https://raceandiqmyths.blogspot.com/)

Lynn and Becker could have used some of the data from there, but they didn't which is ""interesting""."
300,227,bjn5py,brainstation,The Bell Curve- get real,samharris,natrumgirl,2019-05-01 18:04,0,"My alignment with Sam Harris on this one is complete and it frustrates me that people can't face facts.  I had a disagreement with a black friend who has defriended me because I was positive that there were more murders in certain areas of Chicago.  The comment was that ""statistics are manipulated"".  Bottom line, if you can't face reality, then you will never grow.  It is ridiculous that the location of murdered people in Chicago is significantly manipulated. It is highly scrutinized information published  in the paper.  It would be nearly impossible to result in a large statistical swing such that there were not more murders in certain neighborhoods.  If you can't face this fact, I really question your critical thinking skills.

&#x200B;

So this brings me to the same discussion that Sam Harris had on the bell curve.  I did not discuss this with my friend, but why the heck do you think that nobody, black or white, has been able to prove that there is a bias in IQ testing that makes it worse for Africans and apparently better for Asians.  Yes, us white Americans intentionally wrote a test that makes Asians smarter than us.   [https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html](https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html)

&#x200B;

I am 1/2 Croatian, which says the average IQ is around 90 pts.  Do you see me getting upset and saying there is no way it is accurate.  It does not define me nor my capabilities.  An excellent point is the IQ of India, most Indians I know are exceptionally  intelligent.   As Daniel Kahneman said ""Science has a way of pointing out things we would really rather not know"" (paraphrase).  Just because you don't like the results, doesn't mean that the statistics are wrong.  And if you think they are wrong, then prove it, don't make blanket statements.

&#x200B;

Incidentally, I would agree that poverty and nutrition will have a significant effect.   However, Mongolia is the outlier in that unless they did not test people in the countryside.  There are countries with similar poverty levels on both sides.

&#x200B;

I do have a theory.... intelligence increases with the amount of Neanderthal in your DNA.   I am only guessing this because Asians have more Neanderthal in their DNA."

Here is the map of every country's GDP per capita

You can notice that northern countries with cold climates tend to fare better than hotter countries.

Here is an IQ map

 [https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html](https://brainstats.com/average-iq-by-country.html) 

Again northern countries with colder climates take up the majority of the top 10.  

This isn't some random coincidence, this shows us that people who are from regions with colder climates are much more productive and smarter than the people who live in hotter climates. In cold climates, we're forced to live in harsh conditions which require us to be smart or die off, unlike hotter regions where you can get food easily and farming is much more easier. This is why Africans and some Asian groups can never reach the same rate of development as Europe, North America, and North East Asia. 

So yes, people from climate regions with pale skin aren't the weak ones, we're the smart ones that civilized the globe."
303,230,ke9rl3,brainstation,The Philosophy of Understanding.,consciousness,weezylane,2020-12-16 9:05,13,"Every deep thinker of his time has come across this question, at least once in his lifetime, without exception: What does it mean to know something? What does it mean to understand 2+2=4? If you google this question, you might get an answer like :

>*Knowledge is belief with conviction of truth based on reason or experience (or both). In other words,* ***we know something when we*** *are (more or less) convinced it is true based on the evidence of our senses or our thought processes.*

This answer involves a lot of circularity, it doesn't define what belief, reason, or experience are and defines knowledge, a mystical thing, in terms of yet other mystical things. It doesn't pass muster for me.

How do brains that are supposed to be a small part of a seemingly infinite Universe, be able to fit the entire Universe, inside it, through mere concepts and computation? If you have read a bit of science or even tried to memorize 19's multiplication table, you will realize quickly that a human brain typically is in fact NOT GOOD at arithmetic. We can't immediately blurt out what is 3413+1223 = ?, but a small pocket calculator, with much less complexity than a human brain can do it in a microsecond. A human brain is built instead, to see patterns; we are visual thinkers. We see in geometry more than in algebra. The concept of a2+b2 = c2 was arrived at by not through pure axiomatic algebra, but through geometry of triangles. The reason fractal patterns capture our attention is because we are built to see patterns.

# The Enigma of Visual Field

But our question remains, what does it mean to KNOW something? What is an **impersonal brain** doing, generating **your personal conscious experience** of a computer screen in your awareness?  But since we can cut open a brain an look at it, we must conclude that brains are capable of looking at themselves! In other words, brains that are made from nothing but fats and proteins, are capable of a mystical process called ""looking"", which represents another brains as images on a canvas that is unknown to us. We don't know where the experience of ""looking"" is happening. We can't see the canvas, but infer that it exists, for it must so, because after all, we can LOOK. As humans we see that we have eyes, that are oval shaped geometrical objects. If we look closer with another object called a microscope, which is also made of geometrical shapes and colors, we can see that this eye, has cells called rods and cones, which are again geometrical objects. We can keep zooming into it, till we reach the atomic scale where we still find more of geometrical shapes. Go much further and you can get into particle physics, whose data looks like, lines and curves, which are nothing again, but geometrical shapes!

In other words, the entire Universe, when ""LOOKED"" at, appears in nothing other than geometrical shapes and colors. A neuron is a funny looking shape. A brain is a collection of funny looking shapes. Skin, bones, muscle, fascia, fat, etc are all geometrical shapes. A virus is a shape. A sperm cell is a shape. Infact, nothing in the visual field, is not geometrical shapes! How can we then be sure that the brain, in fact looks like a brain, when we can see nothing more than the geometry it excites in our visual field?

# Things that aren't geometrical shapes

You aren't just conscious of shapes, but entities like emotions, feelings, tastes, colors, music, tactile sensations, and a faculty of reason and logic, which seems like they reflect the ""obvious"" way of affairs. These things exist to you and are private, but they are not seen or accessible by other persons unless you communicate it to them, and neuroscience has an enterprise of finding the neural correlates or corresponding geometrical shapes your brain assumes when you are conscious of a certain experience. When you damage your brain, say you lose your sense of balance, and neuroscientists can see the signature of a damaged brain and compare it to that of a healthy brain and come up with a theory of which part of the brain controls the sense of balance. But that is just the geometrical, visual aspect of the story. In reality, you experience hopelessness from losing your balance and you might feel despair which is not studied by neuroscience, particularly because it involves a tremendously more difficult analysis of neural correlates over long periods of time, which again are nothing but the analysis of phenomena of changing geometrical shapes in the visual consciousness of a neuroscientist.

On a much lighter tone, you might suddenly come across a big pile of money, and from a scientific view, all that happened was that a mammal came across meaningless printed paper, which changed his brainstates, but we know that's not the whole story. What infact happened is your consciousness made a radical jump and you became aware of more possibilities of spending your new found money on substances or commodities that you desire. These things thus exist, but are not capturable by mere analysis of geometrical shapes alone. Your sense of self itself is an experience that doesn't have only have a visual geometrical aspect to it, but as a part of a much broader set of experiences called memories and reflexes, and biases and all that sort of thing.

# The Phenomena of Knowing

If you have reached this far, you must be starting to question what is really ""real"" then? If whatever that exists, has aspects like geometry, and non-geometrical aspects like color, feelings, then what is the ""thing"" that is in existence and where is it? In other words, what is the source of our perceptions?To that I will give you two possibilities to ponder:

1. Whatever it is that exists, is not ultimately perceivable by you or anything, using any sensory organ or faculty of reasoning possible, because whatever instrument you use will be fundamentally limited by its design and the nature of perceptions it can ask of the source. You cannot have one instrument asking source, every possible question answerable.
2. Whatever it is that exists, exists solely as a perception and nothing more, in Consciousness, including your sense of self, your memories, and every possible enumeration.

Both are mysterious positions to handle, but they are meant to serve as pointers to lead you to contemplation. We must come in terms to that fact that knowledge is indeed a real phenomenon of life where we have a sort of ethereal, non-physical, mechanism of access, to a list of facts that can help make sense of perceptions. But that doesn't explain the fact that knowledge exists in the first place! We see an example of knowledge in action in machine learning. What machine learning basically does is define a set of data structures on a piece of memory, and then using certain darwinian like selection processes, tends towards a structure or mode of action, that will lead it closest to its desired functionality. Our brains are no different, in the sense, that our neurons does exactly that! But just like the RAM of the computer doesn't actually understand truly what it is accomplishing, similarly, our brains being physical systems, don't know what they are doing. You can't interrogate a neuron and ask them what does it feel like to be happy! Similarly, you can't ask an eye cell what does it feel like to look at a vista. But if everything I'm talking about are artefacts of human perception, then this conversation is already useless to answer our epistemic question.

# My personal position on this problem

**A thing can only know itself.** ***A thing cannot know something different from itself, because if it did, that other thing would have something, some language in common, that makes interaction between the two things possible.*** If therefore I am in a Universe, then I can only see those parts of the universe that I truly am myself. In other words, I can only see a brown color because brown is a part of me. If I can see a pattern, that pattern is me. In other words I extend the definition of ""me"" to everything that I can be conscious of. That includes every perception, concept, sentence, memory etc. This is more in line with proposition #2, but again just my personal opinion, you're free to contemplate the answers for yourself as I don't expect you to just believe in me :)

Have a nice life! Be merry and happy! And stay curious."

Asking all bootcampers/bootcamp graduates and self taught Software developers. Also HRs and recruiters

I come from a culture where a university degree is very important on your resume. i've moved to Canada and I am looking to go into software development. i am taking some courses on Udemy and also looking into bootcamp options, like Kickstart coding, Altacademy, Shecodes and Brainstation but my friend said those are weird names and would look weird on my resume

My questions is, will it matter that i don't have a University degree? from an established University? will that be a barrier to entry? I've spoken to some people who all said to just have some projects on my GitHub.

310,237,iwqzhj,brainstation,Douglas college or Langara? + bootcamp?,learnprogramming,Davidaste03,2020-09-20 21:36,11,"Hi everyone, I'm currently looking at IT courses in Vancouver and was wondering if anyone could offer some insight as to which one would be the most useful for the future. My first choice was a bootcamp in web development (Brainstation or Light house) but neither offer a PGWP after graduation. So I have to take a program at college or university, currently  I have 2 options :

\-Information and Communication Technology (Post-Degree Diploma) at Douglas College ([https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/pdict](https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/pdict))

\-Internet and Web Technology at Langara College ([https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/internet-web-technology/program-curriculum.html](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/internet-web-technology/program-curriculum.html))

I am somewhat familiar with coding but honestly I don't know what traits are currently in demand or what should I be focusing on. As a general strategy what u guys think about doing the program college and also the bootcamp, or no need ? And also as a side note, does anyone know how likely is for tech companies to hire an immigrant? (Maybe its a silly question, but hey, its 2020 and everything is crazy) 

Thank you for taking the time to answer."
311,238,g9ub97,brainstation,Covid Career change to UX Design,UXDesign,Flyingotter7,2020-04-28 15:57,7,"Had landed a tech/design job that was close to my dream position about a year ago as a interaction designer for an event company (major league sports, conventions, live events, museums, and brand activations). Was going great until pandemic stuff. Now I’m only employed thanks to the wage subsidy program and that dries up in June then I go on EI. The projects I’m on are pretty much “make work” projects just to justify our existence. I don’t see the company surviving past fall...

I’m hoping to come back to interaction design but it gonna be dead in my area for the next 1-2 years I think. Very self motivated, lots of design experience, and did an MFA in New Media a few years ago. 

I have programming experience but know it’s directed in an area not marketable at the moment (Python/bit of C/C++ and Java). Also have a film and web design background but again not in a traditional marketable area (interactive displays not standalone web/apps). Have 4 years doing architectural/civil drafting and REVIT but was 2008-2012 so don’t think I’m up to date.

With Covid shaking things up, I’m willing to sacrifice some job satisfaction for security. I’m looking at doing Brainstation’s UX course since I already know a lot of the software already already (Adobe, InVision, a few smaller app dev frameworks, and have created HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP based interactive displays). That said, I’m feeling like I should find other resources instead of shelling out $10k for something I can learn in a book off Amazon. 

Unrelated job note: A few cyber security companies have also reached out for interviews, but I have no idea what a cyber security dev does so turned them down (I don’t think the hiring managers know what they do either, they just see “knows [insert programming language] and [insert years experience]” on LinkedIn)

TLDR: to the point, for someone already with a tech/design background, what UX jobs are available that I can work towards doing self learning? I don’t care about jobs satisfaction because Covid is making it difficult just to have a job."

Yet people like Richard Lynn and Becker show that IQ got lowered for some  reason. Becker also posted his study on research gate here-

[https://www.researchgate.net/project/Worlds-IQ](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Worlds-IQ)

You can download his stuff.

I just read more stuff especially about India. The study was conducted and here's the link

[http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jdms/papers/Vol14-issue10/Version-10/D01410101721.pdf](http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jdms/papers/Vol14-issue10/Version-10/D01410101721.pdf)

And they found that 21% female med school students had an IQ between 0 to 39. THIS IS IN LYNN'S citation!!

IQ between 0 to 39 is lower than animals. Assuming that IQ is 40, this is  SEVERE MENTAL DISABILITY. This literally shows how lazily the study is  done. Probably  21% female students didn't even have any interest to  score above 40. Did they test students or patients?

This is med school students we are talking about. And I read that IT IS VERY VERY hard to get accepted in an Indian medical school and it is also pretty hard to pass 11th and 12th grade in India. It is impossible that IQ of 21 % of female med school students is below 40.

Remember guys, Lynn and Becker released this book in 2019.

I can't believe they lowered the IQ. It is as if Flynn effect got reversed. Lol. How can IQ of a country that hasn't and hadn't accepted many mass immigrants get its IQ lowered by 6 points? And a country like Ghana get its IQ lowered by 15 points!!

313,240,injorl,brainstation,Are boot camps really that bad?- [Business Student interested in DS],datascience,omaronn,2020-09-06 6:15,4,"Hello everyone, I am a long-time lurker of the sub and just wanted to ask a question that has been on my mind for some time now. (TLDR at bottom)

&#x200B;

Is going into a data science diploma program from a bootcamp like Brainstation the right decision?

&#x200B;

My background is in business; I finished my **B. Comm in Supply Chain Management** this year and got interested in data science as my program had built-in 2 courses on data science. Learnt a lot about data mining, science, stuff like Bayes Theorem, kNN, etc despite not getting too much coding experience in it as we used analytics software. However, the whole concept of actually using the potential of big data to derive insights for companies, and optimize their operations got me really interested in a career in business-oriented data scientist. Also have a background in stats through my program.

&#x200B;

My work experiences include my internship at a **Fortune500** healthcare supplies company, where I was tasked on doing data analysis on inventory and sales. At this point, I understood that Advanced Excel can only take you so far in data analytics. My other work-related experience was my capstone project with **Walmart Inc**. This involved performing a **data mining project** in regards to their eCommerce fulfillment (can't disclose much more due to NDA).

I really want to hone in on data science, and plan on using it in-tandem with my business knowledge to help firms learn and optimize their business processes. I have been searching through the sub, YouTube, Quoram and whatever source and experience I can find on the viability of a boot camp as a legitimate way to get into the field. I found that a good amount of people are **advising against data science boot camps** (and boot camps in general) as companies and Hiring Managers always prioritize candidates who have a degree in mathematics or CS, rather than a boot camp.

Would someone like me, who is really interested in a data science career and coming from a business background realistically be able to start a DS career from a boot camp?

Is the viability of  bootcamps really that bad? Or is this simply the case of comparing career prospects of students who have only done a degree in CS, engineering, math, etc. vs. someone who doesn't have a degree and only did a bootcamp? This was an impression I got from some of the articles and videos that I read up on. I totally understand a degree is more comprehensive, but will it fit my background as I already have a degree (albeit not in CS/eng/math) or will I need to get a degree in STEM as well?

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, most of the master programs for the current year have already filled, and I will have to wait another year atleast to get enrolled into one of the masters program. I don't want to wait that long, and rather start a boot camp soon and get working experience as a DS sooner rather than being later. Waiting it out would put my career in an awkward position :/

&#x200B;

This has been bothering me for a while, and I thank you for hearing me out :)Any advice or experience from you guys will be really valuable, and will help me out a ton.

I'm interested in taking a full-time Web Development bootcamp in Vancouver this January and have been researching heavily into these 2 schools.

As a bit of background, I'm an IT Support Specialist who also has about a year and a half of programming experience after completing Harvard's CS50 and a CS50 final project in my spare time over the past 16 months:

[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)

[https://github.com/bocajbee/CS50-Final-Project](https://github.com/bocajbee/CS50-Final-Project)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqlg177I2tk&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqlg177I2tk&t)

While CS50 and the Web Development track in this course has given me a solid foundation, I'm seeking to go to a bootcamp to further increase my skills and hopefully land a Jr. Web Dev role out the other end.

I have been accepted into both Lighthouse Labs and Brainstation. However I'm still unsure which one to pick. Something I have noticed about Lighthouse is that they have ""Stretch goals"" for people like me going in with a fair bit of programming experience already. I also noticed Lighthouses interview process was a fair bit more rigorous than Brainstation's.

Whatever bootcamp I go to, I absolutely want to be pushed as hard as possible. So I'd be curious to hear your guys experience if you have been to any of these two schools and what you think would be the best fit for me given my background.

Thanks!"

323,8,tjyclt,Lighthouse Labs,Seeking graduate input on: Codesmith vs Sabio vs Lighthouse Labs,codingbootcamp,Olegreg6,2022-03-22 04:35:22,11,"Hi all, much like many of you I am in the decision process right now, I am about 1-5 weeks from each camp's start date. I'm looking for insight into Bootcamp choices. I am looking to start ASAP as I have some flexibility to take 3-4 months off work and have no prior obligations during that time (weddings, holidays, landlord obligations, etc).   


My background: I'm 30 and changing careers, I was in program management (mental health) for 5+ years prior. I also have a ton of bartending experience as I usually do that on the weekends for extra money and to meet people. I've been a carpenter for a bit as well working in residential remodels while I was in college.  I do have a BA. I am new to coding, but have about 90 hours of experience so far in the last 3 weeks, and am enjoying myself.   


Light House Labs: I am fully accepted into LHL, but I'm put off by them being Canadian-based as they won't have the job connections an American boot camp would, and even more so after reading a fair bit of horrible reviews in regard to material and career services. I've also watched a lot of their student's final presentations and wasn't really impressed as they were fairly simple and uncreative. The positives for my situation are they are cheaper, at 10k USD, and they start sooner, and I've completed 70 hours of their prep course along with passing a technical assessment. I will admit, something doesn't feel great though about the process as it was very easy, and the only emails I've received from admin are ones that ask me to pay early. I know they are legit, I'm just not sure they are the best for me due to lesser curriculum and networking.   


Next up is Sabio. I spoke with them and they sound great, they offer a fair and straightforward ISA,( $19500 max payment), base tuition is 15k with multiple offered scholarships, and you can take a sally mae loan out to cover the expenses. I am not seeing any graduates on LinkedIn though, which is a little worrying, but the folks I have spoken to speak highly of it. I think I would be a good fit there, and their outcomes seem acceptable for the US (median pay 71k, avg job placement is 82% and they exclude silicon valley jobs as not to skew the data). They seem honest and straightforward, which I enjoy in communications with them. If anyone has any experience with them, please reach out.   


CodeSmith: 20k total cost, a ton of prep work which I do not mind at all, but the biggest thing is funding and the 20k vs 15k vs 10k. I see their results though and they are quite impressive, as is their alumni network. I'm guessing after speaking with the recruiter that their tech assessment is fairly tough, but I think they also have the highest quality curriculum of the 3 schools. Their hiring median is 110-120k out of the gate, which is very impressive. I would also love to speak to any alumnus out of there.   


TLDR; Interested in coding, applied to 3 boot camps. What would/did you choose and why?"
324,9,qgovuk,Lighthouse Labs,"Vancouver Web Development Bootcamps (General Assembly, BrainStation, Lighthouse Labs, CodeCore) Help",vancouver,bahamet7,2021-10-27 00:54:56,26,"Hello,

I have been contemplating for a long time to transition into Web Development and was going to start once I decide on a bootcamp. 

I have done enough research to understand that bootcamps grads are not the most sought after but don't really have any other methods to transition (I cannot go to BCIT/SFU/UBC as the time to redo all the requirements will take an extremely long time before I can get into a program, which is not guaranteed as it is competitive + cost). I just hope my high drive and ambition will offset it. I plan to work hard.

Knowing this, I have come to the conclusion I will most likely need to attend a bootcamp. Here is what I found:

|Company|Time Commitment|Cost|Syllabus|Company Site|Other|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|General Assembly|480hrs (8hrs/day) for 12 weeks|$13,950|[Link](https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/production/uploads/program/course_catalog/11342/SEI_Syllabi_062920.pdf)|[Link](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/vancouver)|14hr prep course|

|Lighthouse Labs|720hrs (12hrs/day) for 12 weeks|$13,000|[Link](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/pdf/web-development-bootcamp-curriculum.pdf)|[Link](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp)|70hr prep course|

After all the research, I basically have a few questions for people that are in/recently graduated from a bootcamp. The latest post about bootcamps in Vancouver is 7-11 months ago. I was hoping to know if anyone had gone through any of these more recently. I always only hear about Lighthouse Labs and that's pretty much it. Also if anyone has any input on their career/job placement services after the program it would mean a lot to me (as that seems the most important next to content). All these websites and online research suggest they are all good, but it is hard to distinguish which one is may be the best choice as I assume the reviews are usually biased in some way. It would be awesome to hear from grads about all 4 schools. I plan to self study for about 2 months before applying to one (as they recommend applying 4-8 weeks ahead) and was also wondering what kind of interview questions are usually asked in the application process. Also outside of the bootcamp, if you found a mentor, how did you find one?

For people with some experience, here are some additional questions. What kind of pay can you expect as a Junior Dev after a bootcamp (seems to be 40k-60k)? Is it different than if you graduated from BCIT/SFU/UBC? Is the demand still there for FE/BE/Full Stack developers or is it dying down? If any experienced person could even check out the links and see which curriculum from which school may be covering the most relevant and useful topics, that would also be appreciated.

Thank you and I hope you have a wonderful day!

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your advice. It looks like paying for a bootcamp may not be considered the best option (I mean there is some positive sentiment but mostly self learning and being involved in good projects seems to be the way to go) if you can be motivated enough to self learn. I will just look for work as I am currently unemployed and give it my all in learning for the next year. Hopefully I can find work but sadly it isn't easy to find work in my field (especially being so close to the holidays). Bootcamps are something I can choose to revisit in the future if I really need the structure or have use for the career services all of them seem to be providing. I hope you all have a great day and once again thank you (I will come back consistently for the links and advice you gave me)!

Update: Please see my updated post. I know I wrote about that I wouldn't be taking a bootcamp but as I continued studying, I knew I wouldn't be able to do it alone. I eventually did more research and ended up going to LHL. You can see my bootcamp experience and how I got employed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/uhrf3r/vancouver_web_development_bootcamp_update/)."

I've heard it's very intensive, 10-12 hours a day on weekdays and 7 hours a day on weekends, with 10 assignments on average each day. And if you fall behind for 1-2 days then they'll have to roll you over to the next cohort.

I'm also want to find a job asap, so I'm worried taking the extra time of 7 months as opposed to 3 months will be too long. And I'm wondering if employers will look down on those who choose the flex option as opposed to the full-time option.

I'm interested in taking a full-time Web Development bootcamp in Toronto this Summer and have been researching into these two schools.

I have a coding background and I worked as a web developer for 2 years but I have a 3 year gap in my career and I feel the need to refresh knowledge. I truly want to go back to development. I have been trying to do this in my free time but with my full-time job I end up exhausted and I don't feel like I am progressing.

Also, I came to Canada a couple years ago and I have no connections whatsoever, so I think the networking side of it could be beneficial for me.

I want a bootcamp that will challenge me as much as possible. So I'd be curious to hear your  experience if you have been to any of these two schools and what you think would be the best fit for me given my background.

Also, since COVID started, I wanted to know if this has affected people's experience taking the bootcamp online and finding a job afterwards.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I decided to go with LHL since from the very beginning the process with Brainstation has little things that I did not like, including the fact that they offer career services only for 6 months after graduation. I start in August ! 

EDIT 2: I went to LHL. Finished the course last November 2021 and found a job in 2 weeks. My experience at LHL was very good, it was the refresher I needed and I learned a lot of basic things that I never learned before which was wonderful. 
I was worried because the course was all online and I thought I'd miss out on opportunities to network, etc. But actually doing it online was better. You do spend 10+ hours a day as they say doing the daily work and assignments, so to me not commuting and eating at home was a plus.
The instructors are amazing and super friendly. I was pleasantly surprised with career servinces' support while looking for jobs, I ended up landing a job via LinkedIn but I got a job offer from a LHL contact as well. 
A lot of my classmates without experience as developers found jobs very quickly.
Best decision ever ! I hope this helps.

Join my team here: [https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/teams/join/maplestory](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/teams/join/maplestory)

&#x200B;

I've got the interview for Lighthouse Labs coming up, but one of my concerns is whether or not I'll get the full value of the course because it will be completely remote this time around.

Obviously everyone is hoping that things will return to normal shortly, but with the way things are being projected, the entire 3 months of the Bootcamp may be online. One major value of the course, I believe, is the networking and in-person learning.

&#x200B;

Can anyone give me on their opinion on what kind of value I'd be losing out on? Also, any tips for the interview would be appreciated also!

&#x200B;

Stay safe and stay home guys.

Brainstation seems like the most viable because you can pay in installments for up to 24 months, the other two its a bit more tough to pay (especially LHL since its upfront). I am wondering if anyone has attended any of these three and could give me any insight on which one I should select? Curriculums seem all the same to me so I guess the only thing left to base it on is real life examples of people who went to them and succeeded."

2. Did you have a degree related to data science or in any other profession prior to joining the bootcamp?
3. Were you able to get job interviews and were employers interested in hiring you? 
4. What type of help Lighthouse labs provided you with in terms of job search?did they connect you with prospective employers?

First of all I hope I'm not breaking any rule by making this post, I've read all the rules and I don't think so, but English is not my first language so I may be wrong.

I am working as a web developer (backend) in a big company for 15 months most of my work is with java and SQL. I have also learnt by myself Python and its modules numpy, pandas, seaborn and some more by reading and studying some books, even though I made a lot of practical exercises I have not done any big projects with those tools. 

I have a college degree in biotechnology but is not related with programming so it doesn't count. I got my job with online courses in java and a free bootcamp I found. 

My first question is about the bootcamp itself, do you recommend It? What do you think about the part-time one? it suits better my schedule right now.

Do you think that with my background I will be able to get the best of the bootcamp?
And do you think it's a great option for changing my career path and get data science jobs?

Me apaixonei por programação em uma pós-graduação que fiz numa extensão de jornalismo, lá mexi com Python para tratamento de dados e Javascript (além de HTML e CSS) pra storytelling.

Nessa busca pela transição para web dev, estou considerando fazer um bootcamp. É importante pra mim que o bootcamp seja presencial e que eu possa fazê-lo à noite, já que não pretendo abandonar meu emprego atual enquanto não tiver outra oportunidade.

Encontrei dois programas que me chamaram a atenção: Ironhack e LeWagon. Os preços são beeem salgados, mas estou considerando. Eu sei que existem opções mais em conta ou até mesmo de graça na internet, como o Odin Project. Mas sinto que o fato de ser presencial, permitir networking e me colocar para trabalhar junto com outras pessoas vão me ajudar nessa transição.

IronHack destaca aplicação web MERN e ReactJS...

LeWagon foca em Ruby on Rails. Não entendi se eles passam por ReactJS...

I haven't attended a boot camp myself (a part of me is considering it), but I have spent the last 2 years studying front-end development. The first 6-8 months, I started dabbling in HTML and CSS and a little bit of JavaScript and started building some sites of my own. Since a bout a year ago though I started getting more serious and I decided to do MITx's intro to comp science with Python. After that I did the Harvard CS50W course on web-dev with django and Javascript. Earlier this year I did Udacity's front-end nanodegree course. I think I'm mostly done with courses and I've started trying to find work in the industry while doing a bit of freelance and volunteer work.

But yeah, I'm looking for others who either went to a code boot camp or self-studied like myself and managed to get employed here. I'm already looking on places like Justa, AngelList, LinkedIn, etc. Recruiters from large firms aren't really useful for entry level devs, but I'm on their lists anyway, but I'm looking for more practical advice from those who went through a similar process."

I'm considering a possible career change, but would like to devote most of my time into studying. I currently have a desk job, 50k/year with two bonuses. This might not seem like a lot, but I was quite proud when I landed the job (an upgrade from getting short-changed as a teacher). However, I'm not learning anything and it provides me no opportunities to return home and find a decent job.

Of course, quitting my job to study is a big risk. Even though I have saved up, my fear is not being able to land a job after boot camp and maybe even getting paid at 29.5 hours again. I'm currently a keiyaku-shain, but in another year I will be eligible for seishain.

I have studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own, but I really cannot focus on it with the amount of work at my current job. I enjoy learning these languages. My hopes are that with programming knowledge, I have more opportunity to work as well as a larger salary.

Any small discussion appreciated. God bless."
419,59,hw4m92,Le Wagon,Should I give up on 1992 Toyota Camry LE Wagon?,Cartalk,the-swede1,2020-07-22 19:23:38,1,"I have a poorly maintained 1992 Toyota Camry LE Wagon 4cyl with 140k miles on it that has been sitting unused in a garage for the past two years. I recently decided to get it up and running again so I brought it to a local mechanic for a general health-check. After being given the thumbs-up from said mechanic, I got it registered and took it to get inspected (by a different mechanic in a different state).

Surprise, surprise, it failed inspection. Apparently there are leaks in the exhaust. It does sound like a hot rod these days and the sound seems to be originating from close to the engine. It also smells of exhaust inside the car (I've been driving with the windows down because the AC doesn't work so hopefully I haven't been inhaling a ton of bad stuff). I don't know much about cars. Is it worth trying to fix something like this? I doubt this car has any resale value in its current condition so I'm not super interested in throwing a lot of money at it. But at the same time it has been in my family since '92 and has great sentimental value (and actually runs just fine other than the leaks).

Are any exhaust leaks acceptable in New York state? I've been given conflicting information from different mechanics. Some have said only leaks before the catalyst are grounds for failing inspection, and others have said that no leaks are acceptable.

Happy to provide more information."

Science is a long, gruelling process of numerous repeated steps and re-testing of results to gain an accurate understanding of the immensely complicated processes that take place in the universe. 

Religion is based only upon Faith, and one argument I've seen a lot from religious people is ""something cannot come from nothing"" - and also, ""then how was the universe created""

And I find, that the best possible response to this, is that we do not know the full science behind it. YET. 

For example, we have only known about evolution, as a theory, for roughly 160 years. Thats a blip even in the scale of human existence. Humanity used to think the world was flat, that there was no American continent, or that the stars were gods. 

Science advances. Religion ALWAYS retreats. 

There is not a single case in the last 500 years, where some discovery was made, that supports the narrative of any religious book. Discoveries, only ever support science. 

Therefore, religion has to change. And it does, and now most Christians accept evolution. But this just shows how weak religion is, they didn't gain this knowledge of creation from God, they gained it from the hard work of scientists and biologists. 

Science always advances, religion always retrats"

  My name is Jose, I'm the founder of Data Science Retreat (DSR). We have bee in in the market for 5 years and have graduated 17 batches. We take people with an average of 5 years of experience and some machine learning knowledge and push them hard till they become 'market ready for an ML job.' Our graduates went into companies like Thoughtworks, Bayer, lots of startups.   
  The purpose of DSR is to make products that help the most possible people to live a healthy, autonomous and meaningful life.   
  You can talk to alumni as we list their linkedin profiles on our site. You can also watch videos of projects they made (We are two batches behind editing videos, and there are some cool recent ones!)   
  Things teams have built so far:  
 

* A microscope that runs on a phone and detects Malaria ([http://aiscope.net](http://aiscope.net/))
* A tool to extrapolate the roughness of sidewalks to help wheelchair users to pick the smoothest path between two points
* (in progress) A toy self driving car that picks up cigarette butts ([https://emilypicksup.wordpress.com/blog](https://emilypicksup.wordpress.com/blog))

 Most course materials are on GitHub (under each teacher's name).   
  How do you qualify?   
 

* Apply, book interview (the sooner the better, as the course starts July 1st)
* Pass phone interview (nothing major here, no white-boarding or silly questions)
* You commit to do a team ML project with social impact and work on it exclusively for at least 3 months after the course ends

 Bonus points:  
 

* you have been involved in a project with social impact that uses technology
* you have contributed to open source

 Before you pick a slot to interview:  
 

* Make sure you can be in Berlin from July 1st to Sept 30
* Make sure you can sustain yourself for 3 months and pay the remaining tuition (6000 eur, in instalments)

 This is an experiment. We have had scholarships for women, and need-based ones, in the past. Also to encourage diversity. But I think this model fits best with our purpose: to make products that help the most possible people to live a healthy, autonomous and meaningful life."

Got some pretty good responses, so I decided to write + document more of the applications I'm discovering.

**I'm actually really excited about this one, since I was in a graduate program for statistics.**

[Here's the guide](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-data-science?utm_source=r) for doing data sci with ChatGPT

The tl;dr is that I show you some of the crazy data sci stuff ChatGPT can do:

\- Read and analyze raw CSV data. I just had to copy and paste.

\- It could tell what kind of data you're feeding it judging by the header columns!

\- It will give you the python/r code on how to run specific analysis.

\- It even knew how to use scikit-learn to run regression models 🤯 (I mean, this makes sense since it's an AI tool lol).

Honestly, this is just crazy to me.

**Before I dropped out of graduate school for statistics, I often consulted non-technical researchers in the social sciences. It was always a pain for them to run datasets by themselves just to get some answers to their questions.**

Although ChatGPT isn't perfect (and does make mistakes), it's crazy where the tool is going.

I think this is really good news for a lot of people who are interested in doing research, but might feel too intimidated by needing to do stats. Obvi...some bad stuff could come from it. We'll see!

Hello, my name is Alexander and I'm a recent graduate of [The Data Incubator](http://thedataincubator.com) program.

I know before I joined the program [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) was an invaluable tool in helping me make my final decision to attend (a big shout out to all members who responded to my private messages) and this in-depth (read: way too long) review is my small attempt to give back. I also believe that my perspective is somewhat unique in that most of the existing great reviews out there are from a fresh grad/post-doc perspective while mine is one from someone who is already an  experienced professional looking to transition into data science.

#About Me

I'm formerly trained in computer science and have been a [Senior Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandersack314/) for over 15 years. I started my career with a deep love of operating systems and UNIX (I'm getting old, I remember installing RedHat from a dozen or so floppy disks) so the first half of my career has been spent writing fairly low-level/high performant (well, sometimes) code mainly in C/C++. So think storage and network drivers, boot code, deep packet inspection, and just general platform work.

However in 2016, I read [""The Great A.I. Awakening"" in the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) and was completely blown away by it. The only time I have ever heard of anything related to neural networks was the venerable perceptron algorithm which I knew was [used on some CPUs for branch prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/903263). But I had no idea how far the AI community had come with deep learning and vowed that I wanted to be part of the action too! Since then I've taken numerous online MOOCs on machine learning and now consider [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) to be one of my closest friends (disclaimer: I have never met Professor Ng).


#The Data Incubator (TDI)

If you aren't familiar with [TDI's Fellowship program](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html), it is considered by many to be one of the premier data science bootcamps in the country (US anyway). It is an eight week program that is supposed to not only teach you the foundations of data science but also help you land a job as well through their ever expanding partner network. Their main competitor is probably [Insight](https://www.insightdatascience.com) but they are also battling an entire cottage industry of multi-week camps such as [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/) and [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com) to name a few.

##Admissions

What's makes TDI somewhat unique compared to other bootcamps is their non-trivial admission process which is broken down into three rounds:

* Resume/CV Review
* Project Challenge
* Capstone Pitch

My guess is the majority of folks get past the first round provided you have a graduate degree from a [reputable university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO1061QisVs) but get rejected in the second round during the project challenge phase. They claim their acceptance rate is 2-3% which is about right: My cohort I think had ~4k applicants with a little less than 36 attending.

The project challenge is actually broken down into two or three subprojects with each subproject covering areas of probability, statistics, and basic data science (mostly dataset handling and EDA, not modeling). I would say knowledge of Python is pretty much required to get through the challenges intact.

This is how it works: TDI will send you a link to a real, midsized dataset (at least a few gigabytes) and ask you to perform some in-depth EDA about it. For the stats/probs part, they will ask you to write some code to simulate an experiment and then ask various basic probability questions about your results. So I would say if you are looking to ""book-up"" for the admissions process you should be fairly comfortable with Python, pandas/numpy, web scraping, and SQL. Obviously, challenge questions will vary with each cohort but my guess is they are all similar with respect to the skillsets you need to do them. You have a few days to finish it and can submit as many times as you want, i.e. you can work on some, submit, work on another part, submit, redo the first section, submit, etc.

I talked to several classmates about the challenge project and I think on average most folks said they spent at least 20 hours working on it - so be prepared. The admission process says it takes a few hours to finish but that is just not realistic unless you happen to be not only fluent in the above technologies (I was) but also familiar with the dataset in question (obvioulsy not).

Frankly, I found all the challenge problems to be a lot of fun! I got to not only flex my data science muscles but also learn a few things along the way. However, I must admit that if I hadn't gotten accepted into the program it would have been a heavy investment on my part with very little gain (I literally didn't sleep one Friday night coding one of the challenges up, read: the wife was not happy).

If you make it pass the first two rounds, next is your capstone pitch which consists of a stand alone short video of yourself explaining what you want to do for your capstone project as well as a separate video preso further explaining it. It's typically very high level though; some candidates (including yours truly) had alpha/beta-ish projects from other courses as a basis which gave us a clear advantage while others were still in the incubation stage (literally a single page with scribbles on it that vaguely resembled ""Look out, Data Science!"").

Note that this round is mainly about gauging your personality, how you present in front of a crowd under a time crunch, and how articulate you are when talking about a technical topic. My main advice here would be to practice your pitch and have a few sensible slides to work off of. Please note that you do not get to share your desktop but rather have to send your slides to everyone over a chatroom, which means you can't drive the whole process as you normally would in a formal presentation.

If all goes well, you're in! Congrats!

##Fellow vs. Scholar

During the admission's process, you can apply to be a Fellow or a Scholar but what does that *really* mean since both are part of the Fellowship program?

Fellows attend TDI tuition free but have to **agree to interview with TDI's partner network for a period of time** before being able to interview with any company of their choosing and have to **attend in-person** and thus can not be online.

Scholars on the other hand have to **pay a tuition fee** but are **not tied to TDI's partner network**. They can also **attend online** and are **eligible for a 50% refund if they land a job with a partner**.

However, after the admissions process, everyone is treated as a Fellow, i.e. there is no distinction during and after the program. It's purely an admission distinction only, and in fact the faculty at TDI treat everyone as Fellows - that includes partner meetings, projects, you name it. Again, there is no distinction once you start the program.

I attended the program as an Online Fellow since I worked full-time and was not going to leave my current job without another one in-hand.

##Online vs In-Person

One aspect about the TDI Fellowship that really stands out is that it was designed to be accessible for online students since its inception. It's one of the major reasons why I applied in the first place and why I think the Insight program is a bit behind the times in this regard.

But that begs the question: Do you loose anything by being an Online Fellow instead of attending In-Person? Yes, there are a few drawbacks:

* It's harder to build a relationship with any of the extremely talented and smart people in your cohort. My advice is if you are near any of TDI offices you should trek in for various events such as Partner Panels mainly in order to mingle with your classmates. That's how I made a few friends!

* Some of the resident data scientists are honestly not as chatty as they should be over Slack. Getting help at times was like pulling teeth and it shouldn't really feel that way. Obviously, your mileage may vary, but that's how I felt throughout the course minus our capstone group leader who was awesome.

* Working with the HR folks over Slack can be very painful. For example, an announcement is made for a company you are really interested in interviewing with but have a few basic questions not covered by the CRM so you quickly direct message the primary contact managing that account hoping to get an answer immediately. Think again. My guess is these folks are uindated with requests all day long and it's just hard for them to be very interactive over chat. Most of the time I would send a direct message and wait at leat 24 hours for a response. My guess is if you were in person it would be easier to interact with these folks and get the information you need faster or at least confirm the person is researching the answer for you. When you are online, you stare at a blank chat window for a while and hope they get back to you. I actually think one big improvement would be to treat the CRM kinda like [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and have the ability to file Issues in your dashboard (each Issue would be a question that would start a thread). I think this would be much more effective way for everyone involved.

* Attending Partner Panels as an Online Fellow meant very little interactivity with said partner - both during and after the session is over.

* There is no graduation ceremony for Online Fellows. Very minor but definitey something they could easily improve upon. I kinda felt that with the Online folks they should do a final get together to talk a little bit about their experience and do some kind of exit interview as a group.

##Location, Location, Location!

TDI is a self-styled WeWork company so all the classes are held in shared workspaces (read: at any given moment that location's wireless connection may just drop). At the time of this writing, the main office locations are in New York, San Francisco and D.C. Everyone else is online. Note that your daily lecture maybe given from any of these sites based on what resident TDI DS is teaching it.

Here's the thing: If you do decide to attend in-person, your location will have a huge impact on your placement as the bulk of TDI partners are located in New York and San Franscisco (which to some extent is to be expected). If you are willing to relocate though, then this may not be too much of a big deal. But for those looking for jobs in their local metropolitan area, you are most likely on your own. Don't get me wrong, TDI has partners worldwide (seriously they do) but there is definitely a high concentration of them that bookend the US Coasts.
 
##Onboarding

Before you officially start your cohort, TDI has a 12-day onboarding program that they recommend you work on as well as **a homework project that you must complete and submit before attending class**. So be prepared to start coding on day one after accepting the Fellowship.

The 12-day program is a crash course in data structures and algorithms, probability/statistics, and Python. Take it seriously. One of the biggest mistakes many Fellows made was to not to do go through the 12-day program in earnest and to work on their day-one homework assignment late in the game. I'm telling you as someone who knew about 95% of the 12-day program that I still needed a refresher on a few things: When is the last time you did any kind of dynamic programming? When is the last time you had to write quicksort from scratch? You get the idea.

##A Day In the Life of a Fellow

Each day the course follows the following outline:

* Coding challenge
* One hour lecture on the topic of the week
* Time to work on the Mini-Project due that week
* Capstone group hours/pitch night discussion (twice a week)
* Job interview lecture (twice a week)
* Office hours (once a week) to discuss any mini-project issues/roadblocks
* Partner Panels (one or two a week after the first month or so)

###Coding Challenges

Every morning you have an hour to do a coding challenge. They are mandatory and vary wildly in quality. Once thing that really bothered me throughout the course was the fact that the coding challenges are somewhat random both in topic and difficulty. I also generally believe that [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems are generally less useful than say [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) which groups coding interview questions by company which is key if you are trying to find a common thread of topics across industries to study (and also somewhat motivating knowing full well that you may see that exact problem in an actual interview). There were many times while struggling on one particular HackerRank ""Hard"" problem where I was like no one (not even Google) is gonna ask me this.

The resident data scientists will go over the solution afterwards; though the reference solutions are sorely lacking in detail and occasionally flat out ridiculous, i.e. the solution will focus on brevity instead of explainability. But overall, I do think the coding challenges were good practice and gets you in the mode of what a job interview could be like. 

###Lectures

Every day there is lecture on a particular aspect of a major overarching topic for that week. So one week it maybe on machine learning while another week maybe dedicated to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Since they are only an hour each, it can sometimes feel very overwhelming, or counter intuitively very underwhelming, depending on your existing background on the topic and the course material itself. Most of the material is driven from a bunch of loosely coupled Juptyer notebooks which is good and bad - I found there was absolutely no excuse to have to open up multiple notebooks for an hour long lecture. I think that is just lazy and the notebooks should be re-organized accordingly. But I admit it's a relatively minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.

As for quality, again, it varies a lot. For example, I got a lot out of the Apache Spark and MapReduce lecture series and miniprojects since I have never worked with either of those technologies before and was very eager to learn. However ironically, I didn't get that much out of the machine learning ones since I already knew most of the material.

Overall, I think the lectures were OK. It's just very hard to teach advanced subjects in one hour chunks and it shows.

###Mini-Projects

The mini-projects are nothing short of fantastic! Seriously, if there is one aspect of the program that I think they got right it's this one. They are challenging, realistic, and attempt to really test your understanding of the subject matter they cover. They are also as a result a lot of work and sometimes a bit frustrating too (and this is coming from someone who finished all of them a month early).

Every Satudary that week's mini-project is due and is auto-graded on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale. You need to get a 0.9 or higher on every mini-project to graduate the program. If you fall behind then you loose access to the CRM until you catch up. One thing they made clear is that this isn't to punish the Fellow. Rather, it's to ensure you understand the underlying course material - and I agree with them. Completing these mini-projects not only gives you a sense of accomplishment but actually makes you feel like a data scientist!

###Capstone

Throughout the course you will be working on [your capstone](https://deepmetal.herokuapp.com/). The capstone can be the one you pitched during the admission process or can be sponsored by a TDI partner. I know what you're thinking: Of course, I'm going to do one sponsored by a TDI partner since that will allow me to get in the door for a interview and land that dream job! Well, yes and no.

I had two online colleagues that did sponsored projects and were treated pretty poorly by their partners. One person finished the capstone and the partner didn't even show up to watch the person pitch it during Pitch Night (I'm pretty sure they didn't even get an interview to boot). Ironically, another was treated fairly well up until he actually finished the project (he did a fantastic job too) only to find out that his partner wasn't really interested in hiring him full-time. My advice is to research the ""sponsor"" first and try to gauge if there is a post-capstone process in place.

In general though, I would pick a capstone you feel somewhat passionate about - either in its subject matter or its methodology. Remember, this project is mainly for you in that it gives you something to talk about in an interview when asked what kind of DS have you done outside of saving passengers on the Titanic (drum roll please)!

###Job Interview Lectures

These were obviously less useful for me since I have been in the industry for many years and have gone through several interviews in my career. There are few things that I strongly disagreed with that they stressed during the lecture (outside of maybe finance I would never ever wear a suit and tie to an interview - not happening) but that's for a another day.

Overall the job presos were presented well and I did learn how to write a proper cover letter (though a few of my more experienced colleagues debated if anyone actually reads them?). I am also very happy with my updated resume.

###Pitch Night

Pitch Night is exactly what it sounds like: Fellows pitch their capstones to a few TDI partners in order to both sell themselves and indirectly the quality of the TDI program. I participated in it and I thought the experience was positive overall. I **did** have the feeling that Pitch Night is more about TDI showing off their product (read: me) more so than about Fellows getting actual job interviews. But to be fair, that might have been more to do with the group of partners that showed up than the actual format of the program itself (read: selection bias).

If you do happen to be one of the lucky souls that gets voted to do Pitch Night, I encourage you to do it. The process is a bit nerve racking but the TDI staff really excelled at making sure you were ready for it.

###Partner Panels

A Partner Panel is where a TDI partner is invited to one of the WeWork office spaces scattered over the country to give some background about their company, how they hire, what's it like to be a data scientist, etc. Usually, an in-person Fellow is the panel ""lead"" and is responsible for introducing the partner and asking the first set of questions.

I found that the quality varied widely - some partners were really prepared and made me want to interview with them. Others, not so much. But even more disappointing was the fact that Online Fellows had practically zero interaction with these folks which put us at a disadvantage. I also think that this process could be improved a lot by formalizing the partner side more, i.e. require them to follow a certain format and answer a few standard questions right off the bat. But overall I think they were generally positive experiences and I did learn a lot by just listening to partners answer other people's questions. 

##The ""CRM""

TDI's partner network is encapsulated by their internal [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management) website that allows bidirectional communication between Fellows and Partners. Fellows can spam Partners with their CV/resumes and cover letters begging for an interview while Partners can peruse Fellow's resumes/CVs and contact them directly.

**The good**: TDI has built a fairly large partner network and it is ever growing. Also TDI's reputation as far as I can tell is pretty good within the industry, e.g. there are some partners who only hire TDI graduates believe it or not!

**The bad**: The CRM is simply not kept up to date. So there were many, many partners in the CRM that were either listed as inactive or unresponsive. Worse still, there were some partners who were listed as ""active"" who really weren't. Obviously, some of this stuff is out of TDI's control but it is disheartening to spend hours crafting a cover letter the stuff of legends only to find out the company isn't hiring.

**The ugly**: The site iself I found pretty awful in layout and design. Seriously, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is their friend. I also thought even simple things are missing like complete descriptions about what the company does, have they hired TDI fellows before, and any interviewing tips you should know (you can ask for this but I think it should just be baked into the CRM as a free service for Fellows).

##Conclusion/TLDR

TDI is overall a good program and definitely helped me transition into data science. But your results will vary a lot depending on your location, your background, and the number of partners involved in your particular cohort. I think the TDI staff is excellent but there are numerous places where they could improve the Fellowship's overall daily flow as well as make it a bit more personal (especially for Online folks).

##FAQ

- Can you attend TDI as an Online Fellow while working a full-time job?

You can but it will be difficult. I did the program this way but benefited from the fact that I knew the basics of all the topics being discussed and I already worked from home twice a week. The latter allowed me the flexibility to attend all of the mid-afternoon lectures and participate in my capstone study group. Lectures are usually at noon EST so I could just use my lunch hour to watch them. There were a few Online Fellows who did somthing similar. Some were successful, some still struggled to balance everything and fell behind (but did evenutally complete the program).

But the workload is a lot so be prepared to work long nights and weekends. I lost every night and my entire weekend for a few weeks which can be really tough if you have a family (read: I do).

- Am I guaranteed a DS job if I take this program?

Probably not. Based on talking to a lot of folks who took the program in past cohorts, most were still looking for jobs months after the program ended. Again, it's really the luck of the draw when it comes to the number of partners who are participating and how many of them are actually hiring.

- Ok, but do I have a better chance of landing a job if I'm a TDI graduate?

I would say generally speaking, yes! Particularly if you have no formal background in DS whatsoever (like yours truly). It gives you an instant network to work with between TDI's and your fellow classmates. Moreover, if things go well, you will at least land a few interviews off the bat and get some practice in. All good experiences for landing that first DS job!

- Do you really have an advantage using their CRM versus applying directly on the partner website?

It depends. I believe in general, for smaller companies, you absolutely do have an advantage as a Fellow over a random applicant off the ether since you usually get to talk directly to a hiring manager. For larger companies though, I think you are treated like everyone else as most of the contacts are either someone in HR or a corporate wide recruiter.

- What does the average TDI graduate make?

It varies wildly depending again on your location, your existing experience, and the industry you are working in. You already knew that so this answer is not going to be very satisfying. However, it is the ground truth (literally).

- I heard that parters don't offer as much to TDI graduates since they have to pay TDI a finder's fee?

I forgot where I read this (either here or Quora) but this isn't universally true. There is some truth to it particularly for start-ups and small outfits where resources are by definition limited. But for medium to large enterprises, a finder's fee is fairly typical in the industry and has really noting to do with a certain position's salary range.

- I got accepted as a Scholar. Should I try to reapply as a Fellow instead? And do I have a better chance of landing a job as a Fellow vs. a Scholar?

Honestly, if you can afford it, I would advocate that you just take the course. Also, TDI is heavily biased towards having a PhD for the tuition-free Fellowship program so if you only have a Master's degree keep that in mind.

As I said earlier, it's not more prestigious - everyone is a Fellow once you are admitted in the eyes of both the staff and perspective employers. It's simply a matter of cost.

- Is there a TDI Alumni network?

Unfortunately, no there isn't. Apparently, this has to do with their partner confidentiality agreements (at least that was my impression after inquiring).

450,4,id2yq5,The Data Incubator,Financing an Online Bootcamp (The Data Incubator Fellowship),personalfinance,exploringdatascience,2020-08-19 23:38:45,1,"Good evening,

I hope that everybody is staying safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I have a question regarding a financial decision and would appreciate any feedback. As a background, I am living with my parents while working remotely.

This is my financial status. I make about $1500 - $1700 per month. I currently have a little over $10,000 in my checking account. Here are my investments totaling $8,640: $4,300 with Betterment, $2,000 with Marcus, $630 with Acorns, and $1700 in IBM stock. I pay about $500 in rent each month and $50 in student loans.

I was recently accepted to an online bootcamp called The Data Incubator (TDI) Fellowship as an Online Scholar. I was surprised to learn told that the Fellowship accepts approximately 1-2% into each cohort. While I am an academic by training, I have been working autodidactically for about a year towards becoming a data scientist (via MOOCs, Coursera, EdX, etc.) but have not been content with my progress. I sincerely feel that TDI would help academics like myself change career directions from academia to applying those research skills into commercial sectors.

TDI costs $9000, of which a $1,000 deposit is required soon. The bootcamp requires attendance from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday, from September 21st to November 20th. The Fellowship works hard to connect participants to employers through partnerships, and I read that there was a high job securement rate. (However, since I will be participating online, I am a little worried about whether my job searching success rate would be equivalent to that of those attending the Fellowship's career fairs locally. If at all possible, I plan to attend career fairs locally to increase my chances of securing employment.) There are several financing options.

Scenario 1: If the $9,000 tuition is paid in full, there is a $1,000 discount, so I would be paying a total of $8,000 for tuition.

Scenario 2: Through a service partnering with TDI called Credit Climb, I just applied for a $8,000 loan. My loan was pre-approved with an interest rate of 7.25%. Over a course of 36 months, I would be making monthly payments of about $250, with about $925 in interest being paid, as well as $400 as a one-time payment to Credit Climb. Adding the numbers together, I would be paying $1,000 (deposit) + $8925 (loan repayment) + $400 (fee) = $10,325.

Scenario 3: I read about an income share option but am still looking into the exact details, so this scenario may not be correct. As soon as I secure a job with an income of at least $40,000, I would be paying 12% of my income towards tuition for one year, with a $16,000 cap. (For example, if my first job as a data scientist immediately after the bootcamp is $65,000 per year, I would be paying back $650 per month for a year, adding up to $7,800.)

Here are my honest sentiments. Paying the entire tuition up front would be the most affordable option ($8,000) but I would be left with little money left in my checking account. While I am living my family, I am concerned about the prospects of not having a safety net if something unexpected happened.

Taking out a loan would allow me to retain my checking and pay back slowly, albeit about $1,400 more ($10,325). At the moment I am feeling like this might be the most reasonable, less risky option.

I am not certain about how to evaluate the income sharing plan. While a goal is to find employment as a data scientist or a data analyst, there is uncertainty in economic and occupational outlook. If I secure employment that is less than $40,000, I will not have to pay until I do, but if I secure a very lucrative position, I will have to pay a lot (e.g., $1,000 a month, or $12,000 per year, if the role is $100,000). 

I do not consider myself financially savvy, and would appreciate any suggestions. Thank you."

I was admitted as a TDI scholar this Spring with no programming/ML experience. My academic background is a (nearly complete) PhD in Clinical Psychology, but I have always been more interested in research/data analysis than clinical work and recently realized that a career in Data Science could be a good match for me. While I am definitely excited about the opportunity to do the TDI bootcamp, I am hesitant to enroll given my lack of  training in this area and am not convinced I am at the level that I need to be in order to understand the more advanced material and successfully complete the weekly assignments.

After I realized knowing Python was essential to being a TDI scholar/fellow (1 week into the program), I deferred my enrollment and have been learning Python/pandas/data wrangling daily for about 2 months. Now I have to make a final decision to re-enroll or take the partial tuition refund.

Does anyone have experience with TDI , specifically insight about my ability to be successful in this bootcamp given my non-technical, social science background?  Is this program a good fit for me or should I keep learning on my own at my own pace?

Also, I'm wondering what the ballpark job placement rate is for TDI scholars/fellows (especially those w/o preexisting, extensive programming/CompSci skills)? The networking/job placement services were another bonus that attracted me to TDI."

I was offered the scholar position, which means I would have to pay a tuition.  $16 K if I want to go to one of the locales, or $8k if I take the courses online.  That is pretty steep.

474,8,aqa5tq,NYC Data Science,Should I take a course at NYC Data Science Academy?,careerguidance,ToeBeanSoup,2019-02-13 14:08:11,2,"Hey folks. I’m looking for some public health career advice and possible insight on the **Data Science with R: Data Analysis and Visualization** course at the NYC Data Science Academy.

About me: I’m a social worker with a master’s degree in social work as well as a public health. I have thus far only worked in direct practice with clients at really understaffed and chaotic nonprofits but am experiencing some serious burnout as well as vicarious trauma from working with a particularly challenging population. My mental health was in shambles until a few weeks ago and it’s slowly getting better. I’m looking to make a change and am toying with the idea of taking a data science course. I think this will allow me to pivot my career in a way that I can still use the skills and knowledge I have already acquired. I am interested in research positions or jobs at the department of health and mental hygiene for example, basically jobs that have more support, benefits, or flexibility to allow me to take better care of myself and will take me away from direct practice with clients for the time being. I took stats and epidemiology courses in my MPH program and though I wouldn’t say I’m a math wiz, I quite enjoyed them. We barely learned SPSS, let alone Stata and R. It kinda sucked and I want to further hone my skills and improve my marketability.

So I suppose my two main questions are:

1. **Do you think learning R will help me get a more public health oriented job?** This academy also has Data Science with Python but I know nothing about Python and don’t think many public health oriented workplaces use it.
2. **Has anyone had personal experiences with the NYC Data Academy?** The course is a little over $2,000 and while I’m lucky enough to have the savings, it’s a significant amount of money for me. Obviously, self teaching on Coursera or Khan Academy would be cheaper but I’m not the greatest online learner and the money miiiight be worth it to have access to a real live human to answer my Q’s, have something to put on my resume, get a more thorough understanding of the topic, etc. Any thoughts?

Finally, before anybody gets worried, I promise I am taking good care of myself. I left my old job before I cracked and have been working some odd gigs while I figure out my next step. Doing lot’s of therapy and self care but my brain is screaming out for new challenges. My bank account is shouting a few things too! Thanks in advance for any advice."
475,9,63ljj2,NYC Data Science,Metis vs. NYC Data Science vs. Data Analyst Position,datascience,dtheiceman,2017-04-05 09:34:53,2,"I'm having trouble deciding the best next step to take in pursuit of a career in data science. 

Background:  

I have a BS in Electrical Engineering and have 2 yrs professional experience as a Software Developer. Have been taking MOOCs in Python, data analytics, and some machine learning with some small projects to show off on github. Have been mostly looking at and interviewing for Data Analyst positions in NYC (startups and some bigger industry names) but found that I am getting beat out by candidates with graduate degrees or bootcamp experience. 

Options:

I was recently accepted to NYC Data Science Academy and am in the final interview stage with Metis. I also have another interview with a Data Analyst role in Ad Tech coming up. I don't know if I'll even get accepted to all three options, but in the situation that I do, I'm not sure which is the best move.

Thoughts:

General consensus through google search/reddit seems to be that if you're going to pick a bootcamp, pick Metis. 
The obvious drawback is that it's expensive, and I could theoretically learn the stuff on my own (if I wasn't working full time and could get super motivated).

The great part of a bootcamp is being able to learn a whole lot in 3 months and get a huge amount of help in finding a job (alumni connections, etc.). I'd also hope to make a decent amount more money so I could pay off the tuition pretty quickly.

Getting a job as a Data Analyst would obviously be great as I would get paid while gaining experience in data science. A drawback is that I might not get as much exposure to working in machine learning and advanced data science topics as I would through a bootcamp. Also I don't know if I'd get a much better job after completing the bootcamp than just taking the data analyst position now.


I know most reddit people  think learning on your own and not paying that much money is the best move, but I can't help but think the bootcamps offer a lot more than what I could learn on my own. "

495,29,ns2zlk,NYC Data Science,The truth about Anthony Davis,lakers,lakers_nation24,2021-06-04 07:35:53,102,"Lets shed some light on Anthony Davis's body aka ""mr. glass"" since all I've been hearing is ""lebron is old AD is useless bc he can't stay on the court. Trade AD for dame asap!""

&#x200B;

Anthony Davis, up till this season has played in 528 out 645 career NBA games. That's a percentage of **81.8%** of games played. If we factor in this season, he has played 564 out of 717 career NBA games. That's **78.7%**.

Here's the splits:

'13 - 64/82 - 78%

'14 - 67/82 - 83%

'15 - 68/82 - 83%

'16 - 61/82 - 74%

'17 - 75/82 - 91%

'18 - 75/82 - 91%

'19 - 56/73 - 77%  (AD held out intentionally before trade deadline for 9 games)

'20 - 62/71 - 87%

**'21 - 36/72 - 50%**

&#x200B;

\*Note - Just realized that AD's 2019 season he was held out intentionally before the trade deadline by the Pels for at least 9 games. That brings his '19 splits to 56/73 - **77%**

This bring his overall career average to **83%** of games played excluding this season, and **79.7%** overall.

For the most part, AD stays between 75-85% during the regular season (2 seasons under 75%, 3 seasons above 85%).

Here's his playoff splits:

'15 - 4/4 - 100%

'18 - 9/9 - 100%

'20 - 21/21 - 100%

'21 - 5/6 - 83%

&#x200B;

Overall: 39/40 = **97.5%**

&#x200B;

**How does this stack up to the field?**

According to [this article by NY Data Science](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/an-analysis-of-missed-nba-games/), the average NBA player misses **18%** of games for his career. The average player that's 6'10 misses **20%**.

This data is corroborated by data from [spotrac's NBA injury report database](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/injured-reserve/2019/cumulative-team/). With stat's available for the 2020 and 2019 season, we can do the math as follows:

In 2020, a total of *349* players missed a total of *4580* games for the season. It's difficult to judge exactly how many NBA players count toward the total player count due to players getting waived, sent down to the G league, or signed on short term contracts, but we'll use the league average of *14* players per team at 30 teams in the league to get 420 total players in the league for the season.

Simple math tells us that 4580/420 = 10.9 games missed per player on average, or over the course of roughly 70 games played (covid season, not every team played the same games) is roughly **15.6%** of the season missed per player. That means the average player played **84.4%** of the season.

&#x200B;

In 2019 a total of *350* players missed a total of *5479* games for the season. Using the same 420 total players in the league and 82 games played we can calculate:

5479/420 = 13 games missed per player on average, over 82 games equates to **15.9%** of the season missed. That means that the average player played **84.1%** of the season.

&#x200B;

**AD's career without 2021 anomaly season due to no off season rest -** ***83% of games played***

**Career average NBA player games played according to NYC Data Science -** ***82% of games played***

**Average games played the last two seasons (2018-2020) -** ***84.1-84.4% of games played***

&#x200B;

Anthony Davis is literally barely below **average** in terms of time missed, and this is with data that doesn't account for the fact that he averages 34.4 minutes per game. Considering he is right there at league average in a data pool where the majority of players play between 20-30 MPG, if we compare him among other players of his ""caliber"" (perhaps a 30-40 MPG bracket), he might actually be **more durable** than league average.

&#x200B;

So why does AD have a reputation for being injury prone?

**Because he is - but that doesn't mean he isn't reliable.**

He gets injured a ton, he has recorded **36** injuries up until January of 2019 since entering the league, so that number is likely around **45-50** now.

However, the vast vast majority of his injuries are minor, bumps or ticky tack injuries that sideline him for a couple games or maybe a week. In fact, up until the strained calf this season, the most severe injury AD has ever had in terms of games missed was **11 games over 1 month**, in his rookie season. At no point in time prior to this season had AD ever missed more than 11 games than that due tosingle injury.

To sum it up **he gets injured a lot, but doesn't usually miss much time to recover.**

For example: if player A has 10 injuries throughout the season but misses only 10 games, while player B has 2 injuries but misses 20 games, player A will be labeled more ""injury prone"" as he should, as Player A is constantly getting hurt. However, at the end of the day Player A was still able to show up and contribute more than Player B was because the severity of injuries or recovery time favored Player A.

This is AD's situation.

&#x200B;

Seeing his name on injury reports in the media 10 times a season will definitely give a guy the reputation of being injury prone, but at the end of the day the stat that matters is how often they can dress for games and in that category AD is at the very least, around **league average.** During the playoffs, AD is **among one of the most reliable players** having played in damn near all the games.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So why did I write a fucking research paper on this? **Because we gotta have some faith in our superstar.** Don’t get me wrong - I’m not saying AD is iron man. He’ll likely miss 10-20 games next year to be frank. But cut it out with the “we’ll be lucky if he plays at all!” And “this guys career is done”. This guy came off the shortest offseason ever and compounded with the fact that his body was conditioned to 6 or 7 month off seasons because the pelicans weren't shit his first 8 years completely fucked his body. He was out of shape for much of the season and continued to try to gut through at least one injury basically the whole season. And all he gets for that is our fanbase and superfans (yeah you, Snoop) calling him soft. I've got full confidence that a full 5+ month off season can get this guy's body right and he'll be awesome for us next year, and hopefully reading this gave you confidence in him too."

507,11,10eggb5,Metis,Me meti a un plan de ahorro porque gano en dolares pero...,ArAutos,ProgramadorConGuita,2023-01-17 11:29:22,10,"Buenas, queria contar mi situacion con plan de ahorro a ver que opinan Volkswagen Taos

Me meti al plan en noviembre 2022 por una taos modelo base, el plan es 60% financiado en 84 cuotas, y el 40% ponerlo el dia de adjudicacion.

Mi intencion hasta ayer, era pagar el 40% por adelantado, ir adelantando 7 cuotas durante 8 meses (56 cuotas) hasta que me tocara la adjudicacion, y hacer el cambio de modelo a la taos highline (unos 10mil dolares mas).

recien hace unos dias pague mi 2da cuota, y resulta que llamé a administracion

## Vicente Zingaro e Hijos S.A calle 13 525.

&#x200B;

y me dicen ""No aceptamos dolares, ni transferencia ni efectivo ni nada, le damos un cupon y vaya al banco provincia con 4 millones en efectivo (40%) y adelanta su 40% ""

Claramente esto no fue lo que me dijeron al meterme al plan, me dijeron que yo podia ir a la concecionaria y pagar con dolares en efectivo y que no habia problema, que yo podia ir con mis 10mil dolares a pagar el 40%, y que podia ir con 800 dolares, y adelantar las cuotas que yo quisiera.

(CLARAMENTE no voy a pagar por banco esa cantidad de dinero, porque aqui todos sabemos que no le debemos al estado un 40% de nuestro sueldo contractor para los entendidos. Afip things cof cof)

Estoy por salirme del plan porque vi que hay muchas cosas negativas del plan, porque no pienso ir a un rapipago ni a un banco con 4 millones de pesos en efectivo... apenas llevo 500 dolares invertidos , en la primera cuota inscripcion y segunda cuota.

&#x200B;

Cual es la manera mas rapida de darse de baja ? tengo que mandar carta documento? ir putearlos un rato y salirme? dejar de pagar? como seria?

Pd: ya se que me devuelven la plata dentro de 84 meses, pero prefiero perder esos 500 dolares, que perder el resto si algo sale mal mas adelante.

pd2: creo que optaré por comprar un auto de contado usado.

&#x200B;

PD3: chicos perdon por no aclararlo no me metan hacha tanto, tengo un contador, tengo monotributo, tengo declaraciones de ahorros, tengo contabilidad creativa desde hace un rato...tengo como justificar cierta cantidad de dinero. Aclaro porque casi me quieren matar en los comentarios xD no se enojen tanto

Some thoughts...  


* Mass of the Higgs boson
* Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
* Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture
* Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor
* A warning that tetraethyl lead is poisonous to life based on organic chemistry

With any scientific or mathematical discovery, there's the risk that any civilization advanced enough to receive and understand the message would either already know it or be on the verge of discovering it themselves, so is there any piece of human knowledge that we may have lucked into ahead of our time?"

So, I am currently in graduate school for CMHC, and started at my practicum site in August. I have just started seeing my own clients and my caseload has increased a ton in the last few weeks . I think I went from seeing one client to now having about ten. I know this is not *a lot*, but before this I was simply observing other clinicians. 

I am having severe anxiety about everything; documentation, whether or not I am actually good at this; always feeling like I am going to mess something up or that I already have messed something up. I also have a slew of physical symptoms and difficulty sleeping because of it. It has gotten to the point that it is almost paralyzing and impacting my ability to get things done. I would like to add that I am getting my own counseling, and I did have a brief conversation with my supervisor about this yesterday. Did anyone else feel this way when starting out? Or am I just not cut out for this lol?"

Most are non verbal and the verbal ones refuse, I mean REFUSE, to speak. They rarely imitate and if they do speak its echolailic and generally when we (practicum partner and I) are not paying attention or otherwise trying to engage them. Last semester I had similar kids but my supervisor was physically present and really broke the ice then handed them over. My new supervisor is virtual and can't help as much, and just advises to target engagement through play and learning a few key gestures / words. Which we try but these kids do not engage, if they like something they want it in isolation and the behaviours are so big. It's honestly discouraging me because what am I doing wrong, I'm trying every toy, every song.
It's not been all bad and we've had some moments where we can go yay! But even then half the time they never do it again and even hate the activity they just loved.

522,7,101wadh,Practicum,What actions are being taken regarding the exploitation of Psychology grad program practicums?,psychologystudents,PsyD2B,2023-01-02 22:03:26,82,"I am currently applying for my first practicum, and I continually see discussion on Reddit, quora, and among many doctoral students regarding the sheer lunacy of how we have to work 1000 hours for an entire year for free. 

They expect us to be there three days a week for 8-hour days, some sites want you on the weekend, and this is all on top of a full-time class load and research. I currently work 10 hours a week and can get by with loans, but losing the ability and autonomy to make a living for myself and working for free IN THIS ECONOMY ... WITH THIS INFLATION... is ridiculous. 

I am very much over hearing people say, ""It is all part of the process- everyone goes through it"" -- like yeah, they did go through it when education was half the cost it is now, cost of living was actually attainable, and you didn't have to work multiple jobs to SURVIVE and make ends meat. 

This rant is because I have seen a lot of discussion around the absurdity of exploiting grad students and making them work for free, but what is ACTUALLY being done to change this? I don't know where to start or what to do, but someone needs to get the ball rolling because in doctoral programs, we have 3 PRACTICUMS BACK TO BACK FOR 3 YEARS..... so.... I'm just not supposed to work for three years? or am I just supposed to stop eating, sleeping, and taking care of myself? I don't see why obtaining a doctoral degree in CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY warrants the destruction of one's mental health and well-being. There has got to be some middle ground or something to start this change...

Point being?? Higher education is a classist and oppressive scam that is intended to be for the wealthy and basically nobody else who doesn't make over 100+ K a year or have almost half a million dollars in their savings account."

The practicum site wants me to start next week but I may not start my practicum course the same week as I am waiting on some paperwork. I may end up registering late for the course. Am I still able to see clients although I am not in practicum yet officially?

Also, what would you guys consider some red flags at a practicum site? I was very eager to start this practicum site but now I am not so sure...

The director of the site wanted me to start away and didn't do an interview. Its a non-profit and she said they were in need of people. Their site was super old looking like 70s wallpaper and box VCR TV. Everything is being done with paper and no technology. Like paper billing, paper progress notes, etc. Also no one has their own office and there are just therapy rooms that is first come, first serve it seems like, is that normal?

The part that got me was that as an intern I would get a pair of keys to the building when I need to do my shifts if no one is already there. I wouldn't mind but the office is in a questionable area and she said there will be one day of my schedule where I will be the only person there. Is that normal? Should I be concern?

I am having a lot anxiety starting practicum and idk if its the site making uncomfortable or the nervousness of actually doing practicum.

Any insights would be appreciated!
--------------------‐---------------------------------------------------

Update: Emailed my school and they said no I cannot see clients if I am just starting Practicum, but I can see them if I was in between registering for Practicum as long as it doesn't exceed 90 days.

Also, I can not be left alone on site according to AAMFT code of ethics for supervisors' standard 4.4 and 4.59. Which would imply that trainees should not be left alone at a facility to see clients as this would mean assigning the trainee with the responsibility of being competent to see such clients.

I've never worked in a medical setting before and I'm questioning if I'm smart enough for it. Everything is so new all the time, and because I'm in acute care, I can't reference previous notes that my supervisor has approved because patients move on and off caseload so quickly. I'm a pretty sensitive person and it's hard for me to be so out of my comfort zone and feel like I'm disappointing people by not meeting expectations quickly. My supervisor is nice but I'm just sensing this week that if I've been exposed to something then I should know it by now. Is there anything that really helped others learn quickly?

**!!!ANSWERS!!!**

>!CHART NATIVE: Fridah Kahlo!!<

>!Born: July 6 1907 @ 8:30am in Coyoacán, Mexico.!<

—

>!Let's start with the topic of health first (6H), because this was critical to the life of Frida Kahlo.!<

>!This is a diurnal chart, thus the nocturnal malefic (Mars) is seen as the bigger trouble maker for the native (rather than Saturn). Placed in the 6H this would be a primary indicator of health complications. Mars likes to be violent/aggressive/dramatic. In the 6H it would indicate intense and acute health accidents.!<

>!The planetary ruler of her 4H is Mars, which would tie her childhood to her 6H. At the age of 6 she became infected with polio. This disease resulted in the permanent crippling of her right leg (which had a severe impact on her childhood, because she was then subject to bullying for her limp).!<

>!Uranus conjunct Mars could probably be seen in the “freak accident” that happened to her when she was 18. Automobiles (in the 1920s) were a new technology revolutionizing life for the masses. She was involved in a terrible automobile accident while riding the public bus. The handrail of the bus entered through her abdomen and exited through her vagina. She was left with a broken spinal column, a broken collarbone, a broken pelvis, and several broken ribs. Her right leg was fractured in 11 places, her right foot was dislocated and crushed, and her shoulder was dislocated.!<

>!Her wounds caused her to be completely bedridden for the next 9 months and she was in a full body cast. She would undergo approximately 30 surgical operations in her lifetime (most of which were not super helpful).!<

>!Frida says that her entire life changed after this moment. In fact, she even described the effect that this event had on her life as like “lightning” (talk about a Uranus placement)!!<

>!Mars being opposite her Sun (the planet of vitality) is further evidence for the health issues and chronic pain she faced. Such a placement can also indicate a shorter life span (she died at 47).!<

—

>!Let’s jump across the chart to her 12H.!<

>!Most noticeably is the Sun conjunct Neptune placement. Such a placement would indicate someone with a complicated, changing, and abstract sense of self. I find Neptune is also a good indicator of art (which is the universal language that can bridge boundaries), so this placement surely added to her artistic personality. Featured in her artwork were often surrealist self portraits exploring the many different versions of herself.!<

>!Being in the 12H, Frida spent a lot of her life in isolation and in institutions. After her accident she spent most of her life in the hospital. She struggled a lot with feeling lonely. The polarizing dynamic between her physical health and her mental health can be seen in the opposition between her 12H and 6H placements. Clearly, she struggled back and forth her whole life between physical pain and mental pain.!<

>!The placement of Jupiter here could perhaps be the planet that led her to art. As the planet of good fortune and luck and self growth, she only really found art and connected with it after her accident. She had nothing else to do but stay in bed, so she took up painting! This demonstrates the activation of Jupiter as a result of her becoming isolated. Often the most critical works of art that she produced were generated during these prolonged periods of time alone.!<

>!Additionally, the influence of Jupiter in the 12H can be seen through her substance abuse. Seeking an escape from her constant pain, Frida developed addictions to opiates, alcohol, and tobacco. 12H Jupiter is a great indicator of her inclination toward over indulgence in self destructive behaviors and substances.!<

—

>!Now let’s examine her 1H and 10H!!<

>!Her Leo AC was quite prominent. As a child she attended the National Preparatory School in Mexico City, and she was 1 of only 35 female students at the time. She became rather famous among her peers as being especially outspoken and brave. In fact, her future spouse, Diego Rivera, said that the confidence and ""strange fire in her eyes"" were the first things he noticed about her when he met her as a student. !<

>!Her 1H Leo Mercury is a significant placement. This is a huge pointer towards her being an artist. This house is ruled by the Sun, which is placed in the 12H. Thus the themes she often tried to communicate and express through her art were tied to her experiences in the 12H. As mentioned above, a lot of her work centered on surrealism and self portraits exploring her pain!!<

>!In her 10H we see a loose conjunction between her Moon and MC. This would indicate a career tied to her emotions and personal life as well as her body! Her art focused heavily on these themes. She became quite famous for her expressive and profoundly emotional paintings.!<

>!She became so successful, that she was the very first Mexican painter to ever be featured in the Louvre museum in Paris!!<

>!The 10H is ruled by Venus, which is another indicator of artistic endeavors!!<

—

>!That segues well into our next topic: relationships.!<

>!Her Venus (ruler of the 10H) was placed in the 11H. This is a good indicator that she met her love interest within a social / group / political setting. Frida joined the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, and it was here that she met (or rather reconnected with) the artist Diego Rivera. Not only did they connect via politics, but they were contemporaries of each other. Two artists who occupied similar artistic social circles within Mexico at the time.!<

>!Notably, her Venus is conjunct Pluto. This placement indicates a very intense and dramatic relationship. Pluto being the planet of death and rebirth, their relationship reflected this very clearly. They remained partners throughout her life, but had many ups and downs. They even got married twice! This relationship was constantly dying off and being reborn! !<

>!Throughout their back and forth marriage, both Frida and Diego had many adulterous relationships. With Chiron in the 7H, Frida felt deeply alone. She often tried to fill that void by seeking diverse and exciting relationships. In fact, she was known to have slept with many people, including both men and women. In her time, her sexual identity was restricted, but now she is widely regarded as a historical LGBTQIA+ icon.!<

>!This Chiron placement, in addition to her 7H being ruled by Uranus (in the 6H), could be an additional indicator to the bullying she experienced as a child. Her physical health played a huge role in her relationships with other people. Chiron here shows the ostracization she experienced due to her physical trauma.!<

—

>!Almost done! Let’s look to her 8H house.!<

>!Saturn in the house of death is a primary indicator of death by depression and suicide. Frida was suspected to have died by suicide via opiate overdose. Her journals surrounding her last days were filled with mentions of suicide and her last entry was recorded as thus: “I hope exit is joyful and I hope never to come back.”!<

>!In other regards to the 8H, Frida spent a lot of time struggling with death and sex. She likely thought more deeply about these topics than most people and had profoundly complex perspectives and experiences with such taboo topics.!<

>!Her Saturn is well aspected to other critical placements in her chart such as her Moon/MC, Venus/Pluto, Jupiter, and Mercury. Obviously, the 12H themes heavily influenced her life and especially her artworks. (Her 12H Jupiter aspect to 8H Saturn is another connection to her death from drug overdose!)!<

—

>!Finally, let’s end by taking a peek at the 5H.!<

>!This house is empty which could indicate no children (or no significant relationship to them), but more importantly this house forms no aspects at all to either of the luminaries or Jupiter, and forms an opposition with Venus. These relationships are strong indicators of infertility / no children.!<

>!Additionally, her Saturn 8H could indicate limitations of the sexual organs. As we know, her automobile accident seriously traumatized her whole body including her sexual organs. The accident is likely responsible for the infertility she experienced. Her 6H is ruled by Saturn, so that would perfectly link the accident to her infecundity.!<

My program requires 800 hours in two different educational settings, such as an elementary and MS. My current boss has offered me a part-time position next year while I complete this portion of my program. I know many students choose not to work but that is not an option for me currently. Therefore, I'm trying to understand how part-time I'll be able to work (if at all) at my current school. Or would I be better off subbing or offering tutoring services at night.. 

My question is, how many days a week/hours a day were you completing your intern hours? Were you able to choose the time/days you came in or was the setup for you? 

I would love to hear any of your experiences!

Thank you."

I saw no one has done a practicum in a bit, and I've got a good AA chart for you guys. I extended the days a bit for the holidays and starting later in the week. Beginners and experienced astrologers alike can give it their best shot. The chart can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/z20em7m.jpg).

Please tell me:
1) what did the native do for a living?
2) Some personality traits
3) what were the marriage(s) and children relationships like?
4) Just going to be upfront this time lol. The native is deceased. How do you think the native passed away? Death astrology, forensic astrology, and medical astrology is fascinating. We can respectfully and with limitations see these things in the chart. 

Good luck!


>!The chart is that of Robin Williams, comedian, actor, and voice actor. RIP🙏!<

>!Here is my chart breakdown:!<

>!1)MC in leo. Leo energy wants to be in the spotlight and be appreciated. Really natural actor energy. Mercury in leo conjunct MC can be known for their voice and the entertaining way their mind works and use this in their career. Thus comedy and voice acting. MC/mercury conjunct leo trine jupiter in Aries would create a talker with really boisterous energy. Williams was known for frenetic and manic comedy acts where he would sweat uncontrollably. Aries and leo both being fire signs associated with mercury is someone who has ""zingers."" Mercury/MC conjunct pluto is someone who understands the psychology of people and uses that in career and someone who is transformed by their career. MC/mercury/pluto sextile neptune is someone who can really spin a story and take people to another world with their speech. People were utterly transported by his comedy and acting.!<

>!2) Cancer sun 9th house copresent with mars (ascendant ruler) and uranus. A person who is very family oriented, sensitive, moody, original, and autonomous who may have crisis of faith as a major life theme (9th house theme). Pisces moon 5th house trine mars and uranus is someone who is fun and creative who loves unconditionally but can act impulsively and erratically with their moods. Moon opposite venus is someone who has trouble feeling loved and emotionally fulfilled. Scorpio ascendant must go through painful transformations. Lots of water energy is prone to addiction and escapism, which Williams struggled with all his life.!<

>!3)For marriage, we look to the 7th house in taurus ruled by venus in virgo. Taurus 7th house wants stable and comfortable love. The house ruled by Venus in virgo lends to multiple marriages though as its in a mutable sign. Venus is also in its fall in virgo. Venus wants to keep things light and airy and overlook flaws for the sake of love. Virgo sees the flaws and must delve into things deeply and analyze every part of it. So venus does not function well here and often leads to dissatisfaction for many reasons.  Venus is also sextile mars and uranus, which are separating planets. Moon opposite venus also leads to dissatisfaction. Williams had 3 marriages. The second marriage was with the nanny and likely started while first marriage was still happening. So we can see love life was not the best. For kids, we look to the 5th house.  Moon and NN are here in pisces. Pisces loves with no boundaries and the moon means his kids were his soul and important to his lifepath. 5th house is ruled by jupiter in Aries in a day chart. Kids would be pretty lucky to him! With mutable Pisces and jupiter in Aries being cardinal, we can easily say multiple children. There were 3.!<

>!4) TW: Williams committed suicide by hanging with an underlying illness of Lewy Body Disease. For death, I look to the 8th house of death. 8th house is in gemini, which is ruled by Mercury in Leo. Gemini signifies the lungs and the nervous system among other things. Mercury also rules the nervous system and arterial system and flow of oxygen. Leo rules the vertebra. Pluto and 12th house influences can definitely point to mental anguish/suicide. With these connections we can definitely see hanging/suicide and the asphyxiation aspect of the death. Mercury is trine jupiter in Aries in 6th. Aries rules the head/cranium and jupiter can signify growth, which makes sense for Lewy Body Disease. Mercury sextile neptune in the 12th can point a hard to find illness and mental confusion which Williams had as a symptom. He was not properly diagnosed until after his death by autopsy. 6th and 12th house connections definitely point to illness involved.!<

>!u/frogchairy (thanks for showing your work so others can learn) and u/kal-yani are the winners as they pretty much got every question. Great job guys!<"

I have been having issues falling asleep due to the level of rumination & anxiety about everything that I have to do and whats to come. 

I start my individual clients next week and there's tons of paperwork and technical things I  have to get set up before then. Just thinking about all of it is like an endless to-do list and my mind feels like it won't shut off until its all done. (I have anxiety and OCD which I am in therapy for...)

I also have to do weekly group hours at my site and they've been acting a little shady, so I'm concerned that this site might not be good... They automatically are making me do more hours than is required by my program, but I knew this from the start and was okay with it because I just wanted a site. However now they're trying to make me do even more hours, and my supervisor/boss dude also is saying things that don't add up. I received a welcome letter that detailed my exact responsibilities and requirements upon hire (I'll be here for both prac and internship) and now he's saying things that don't add up to what that letter said. I set a boundary with him and I need to decrease my hours back down to THEIR minimum amount because THEIR minimum is still above my school's requirements! This place in general seems a little off and like it doesn't have the best boundaries. And in my own mental health journey, setting boundaries with a person in a position of authority who I feel like I need to have a good relationship with is incredibly anxiety provoking. Also, he's a little too jokey with me...

Ugh. I'm venting. I'm looking for advice and support. I'm thankfully blessed to not have to work at this time, so I've got that going for me, but I'm doing all this clinical work and an additional class for school and with all of the imposter syndrome thoughts/anxiety about being a good clinician added to all this, its so much."
541,0,zl8ni2,Juno College,Juno College Review,codingbootcamp,SoftwareDevDonkey,2022-12-13 17:11:17,14,"Recently completed the Juno college bootcamp, formerly known as HackerYou and I completely regret my decision. Note: I did do portions of the Odin project ahead of time to prepare for this.

**Intake**

They make you take a test test where the recruiters fear monger you to take their courses about web development and JavaScript. They make it seem like it's crazy hard to get in and preach inclusivity which by nature go against each other. The tech test was something out of code academy about CSS margins and nothing about JavaScript. They often times get people to enroll in 4 thousand dollars worth of courses in which you are given content for free. Now I get the whole point of bootcamps is to make things more digestible but this did nothing to quell that. The majority of the people I spoke to about this said it was things you learn when you first get into development

**Bootcamp**

The bootcamp itself was extremely unhelpful. They preach about the difficulty about it and not being able to hold down a job while attending but the majority of my cohort mates had a job and were doing fine. I understand it was a front end focused bootcamp but the about of HTML/CSS was insane. We spent a total of 5 or so weeks being taught HTML and CSS. It was brain numbing. The only useful thing out of this was being able to use Photoshop conversions to practice but you can get that on any other website.

The JavaScript portion felt rushed. They ignored basic concepts and taught you how to do but not why you do certain things. Often times, the instructors would go on a tangent about survivor or keyboards to kill time, it seems. They could've gotten more into JavaScript essentials. By the end of this portion, the vast majority were struggling with for loops and if statements. We spent more time on how to call an API than anything else. Often times things are overlooked such as advance array methods, reading docs, class based programming, debugging, and libraries which JavaScript is known for. This went on for around 4 weeks which is insane considering that the HTML/CSS portion was very long in comparison. They also did not touch on data structures and algorithms until the last day where they said it might be on a tech test which surprised all my classmates.

The React portion of the bootcamp felt rushed. They gave us two weeks to know the ins and outs of the library. A good chunk of the classmates felt like they were being rushed into react on a unsteady foundation of JavaScript. It felt like the instructors were getting annoyed at the cohort after giving us a unsteady foundation of what they call JavaScript. It was not well done and very rushed. They would also ignore important aspects of react such as useRef or useContext.

The only saving grace about the bootcamp is being about to work in git and understanding how git  collaboration is. However, they would pair up extremely weak programming students with strong programmers which led to a lot of resentment in each of the groups. I would say Odin project did it a lot better and more in depth than anything I learned about Juno.

I completely get why a front end bootcamp would sound appealing considering that the field is vast and what you can do is a lot. however, for what they teach, they do not cover basics of why you are doing certain things.

EDIT: The marking aspect of the bootcamp was completely random as well. Certain things would be pegged wrong even though that's the way they taught in class and didn't us to deviate from it. Juno college hires contractors out to mark your projects where the contractors do not read the project scope and are not keep up to date with what the scope is

**Career Services**

The career team is absolutely abysmal. They want you to apply to 10 jobs a week with introduction emails to each employer. This by itself is not bad, however, they pat you on the back for doing it when it's such a low bar to obtain. They want to keep track of you using their software however the meetings are abysmal. They do not offer any assistance with your actual career. Wonsulting and Jerry Lee are better resources than them.

They do weekly meetings but often times skip out on them. If you manage to get a meeting with them, all they do is praise you for doing nothing. They also waive around this resume book that they pass around to employers if they hit targets which creates a competitive atmosphere amongst the classmates.

They preach about how the careers team is a support system but often time are unresponsive. The network of Grads is much better than them. They also preach about their network of employers but I have not heard of one of my classmates getting reached out by the Juno Network.

**Price**

Now, I completely get that bootcamps are by far no means cheap. But having a bootcamp cost 13k CAD to barely teach you basics is insane. On top of that, a good chunk of my classmates did the web dev and javascript course which total to 4k CAD. The price of this is 17k CAD in total. You're better off going to a full stack bootcamp where they teach you a lot more or even using Odin Project.

**Founder**

The founder itself is a shark. She is not a developer nor understands the pain points. She is simply a business person who sells hopefuls on a tech dream. She has not worked in corporate at all and does not understand the structure of it. It just didn't sit right with me that the founder is only in it for the money and not to help tech be inclusive. She only uses the guise of inclusivity to promote her bootcamp.

**Overall**

I completely regret my choice in choosing a front end bootcamp where they do not teach anything in depth enough. They spent way too much time on HTML/CSS rather than actual programming.  I understand bootcamp is for getting your feet wet but you can get your feet wet for a cheaper price than 17k CAD. The Odin project is a much better bootcamp and it's free. It taught me things more in depth than Juno College."

-After 4 years, I will take 2-3 years off to get my PR as having a PR will significantly increase my chances of admission to med school and also reduce the tuition I’ll have to pay. 

-During those 2-3 years, I will take about 4 months off to go to a coding bootcamp (Juno college is a good one in Toronto) to study programming intensively, at the same time strengthening my portfolio. 

-After that, hopefully I’ll get hired as a programmer at a start-up. I will work there for 1 year and then apply to Express Entry through the Canadian Experience Class and get my pr.

-When I’ve got my pr, i’ll spend about 3 months re-studying for the MCAT. Once i’ve got a competitive score, I’ll apply to med school

So far I know that my plan is incredibly arduous and time-consuming. However, this is the best plan that I could think of right now for me to make it to med school in Canada. If you could share any knowledge relating to this, I would really appreciate that."

I lean heavily towards a Bootcamp with an income share agreement. What do you people think?"
560,19,fq4hij,Juno College,Has anyone gone from complete beginner to developing a career in tech within a 6 months to a year?,askTO,ILove2CumALot,2020-03-27 16:04:00,18,"Hello everyone,

With all that’s going on, I’ve realized I should really use this time to learn a new skill. I work in an industry with no foreseeable upward movement. And I know in the tech world, this isn’t the case. I don’t know how the market will be after all this is over, but I believe the tech industry in Toronto was doing very well before all of this.

Thing is, it’s not really practical for me to go to school for 2-4 years after this. I have people who are dependant on me, and unfortunately I have to keep working for the moment. 

So, what I’m asking is if anyone went through with one of those coding/UX/Web Dev classes/courses that’s always advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Or HackerYou/JunoCollege, online courses or anything. 

I’m willing to put in 3 hours a day towards this. 

Also, if someone is willing to help me learn, That would be amazing!! I’m not the brightest, I’ll be honest, but I’m a very persistent person and will work my ass off until I pick something up. 

Thanks"

Hello!

I've    decided to pursue this path and actually try to learn and better    myself. I just need a few advice on starting up, especially learning on    my own since I will be home for the next few months.

Firstly, I've stumbled upon a discounted **Web Developer Bootcamp** course online from **Udemy**:[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

How good is it? Is it a good start for me?

For a beginner- is **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** a good way to start? Since they are also part of the course I bought from Udemy.

I've also started doing the Python from [Sololearn.com](https://sololearn.com/) and thinking if it is going to be another language that I should learn? I mean **Python** is for **Back-End**, right? And the course I got are languages for **Front-End**?

I    was hoping to make myself some projects of my own in the next few    months, let's say around 3 months from now from scratch? Will this    course from **Udemy** help me out big-time? Or should I also pursue other references?

I was also planning to attend a bootcamp at **Juno College** which is formerly ""**HackerYou**"". Thinking of doing their:

* [https://junocollege.com/course/web-development](https://junocollege.com/course/web-development)
* [https://junocollege.com/course/javascript](https://junocollege.com/course/javascript)
* [https://junocollege.com/bootcamp](https://junocollege.com/bootcamp)

What    are your thoughts on going through these while having the course    material I bought from Udemy? I mean good for learning more and getting    networks and connections, yes?

Furthermore in researching about this, I've stumbled upon more references that I wanna know if they are good  and viable?

566,25,ggi1gc,Juno College,overwhelmed with options to learn coding,learnprogramming,jvn3,2020-05-09 12:06:51,1,"I am someone with absolutely 0 background in coding. I really want to learn a new skill set as even though I have a lot of soft and transferable skills,  I feel like I have no technical skills at all and since I enjoy learning new applications and have interest in IT, I figured why not give coding a shot.

I just dont know which program to choose. There's literally hundreds of options all with competitive pricing and great reviews, some even offer guaranteed job within 6 months, how do I go about choosing the right option for me? I prefer a program where I still get to keep my current day job. I am in rush to switch careers. 

Is there a learning path for beginners new to the coding? Is web development a good place to start with? 

I am in Toronto and really interested in juno college but they dont just accept someone like me into their bootcamp off the bat. I first have to take an introductory web development course and then apply for boot camp."

568,27,fpszzk,Juno College,Career switch from Industrial Engineering to Software Engineering,cscareerquestions,FriendlyStranger96,2020-03-27 03:52:58,2,"Hi guys, 

Would like some input from you guys. I  graduated from Ryerson University (Toronto, Canada) this time last year in 2019 in Industrial Engineering, My experience involves manufacturing from automotive to foods. All in all, I dislike the manufacturing industry and recently just quit my job as a production supervisor that paid $40/hr. It was good pay for me at the time but I was completely miserable everyday going into work and wanted out at the end of my contract. I want to do a career switch to get into Software Engineering; specifically Web-Dev.  I managed to pay off all my school debt and save up around \~25k while still living with my parents right now.

Here are some of my options as of right now.

1. Self teach using online resources, (FCC, Odin Project etc..)
2. Go to a coding bootcamp 
   1. Toronto's Juno College (formerly HackerYou) \~ 12k CAD
   2. New York - Hack Reactor \~  25k CAD
   3. New York - Fullstack Academy \~ 25k CAD

While the Toronto bootcamp is a lot cheaper, the New York grads get paid more and these programs seem to be more prestigious. I'm not completely sure if I should go out of my way to drop 25k on a bootcamp +3 months of living expenses in New York. I know I could get a loan for the tuition and pay it off later, but is it worth it? Having a community of other students + guidance would be a lot of help along this journey. 

What would be my chances of graduating from one of these bootcamps and moving to the U.S (NY, Seattle, SF) to pursue a career in Software Engineering at a high paying tech company?  I plan on finding a job latest by the beginning of next year (\~9 months of study/prep/applying). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

P.S I did complete some programming classes during my undergrad that involved R and C so I'm not completely beginner."

570,29,fqrsug,Juno College,Career switch from Industrial Engineering to Software Engineering,webdevcareerquestions,FriendlyStranger96,2020-03-28 16:26:11,1," Hi guys,

Would like some input from you guys. I graduated from Ryerson University (Toronto, Canada) this time last year in 2019 in Industrial Engineering, My experience involves manufacturing from automotive to foods. All in all, I dislike the manufacturing industry and recently just quit my job as a production supervisor that paid $40/hr. It was good pay for me at the time but I was completely miserable everyday going into work and wanted out at the end of my contract. I want to do a career switch to get into Software Engineering; specifically Web-Dev. I managed to pay off all my school debt and save up around \~25k while still living with my parents right now.

Here are some of my options as of right now.

1. Self teach using online resources, (FCC, Odin Project etc..)
2. Go to a coding bootcamp  

   1. Toronto's Juno College (formerly HackerYou) \~ 12k CAD
   2. New York - Hack Reactor \~ 25k CAD
   3. New York - Fullstack Academy \~ 25k CAD

While the Toronto bootcamp is a lot cheaper, the New York grads get paid more and these programs seem to be more prestigious. I'm not completely sure if I should go out of my way to drop 25k on a bootcamp +3 months of living expenses in New York. I know I could get a loan for the tuition and pay it off later, but is it worth it? Having a community of other students + guidance would be a lot of help along this journey.

What would be my chances of graduating from one of these bootcamps and moving to the U.S (NY, Seattle, SF) to pursue a career in Software Engineering at a high paying tech company? I plan on finding a job latest by the beginning of next year (\~9 months of study/prep/applying). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S I did complete some programming classes during my undergrad that involved R and C so I'm not completely beginner."

I am new to coding/web development here. Theres so many resources out there, free and cheap, where you can self teach yourself coding. However, there are also instructor led courses  such as one offered by juno college in toronto for $2K.

&#x200B;

I was wondering if its better to enroll in the $2K course or just self learn on my own using free material online?"

First Friday Fractals is the spectacular, award-winning full dome planetarium show that takes viewers on a tour of the fractals in nature and zooms through infinitely complex mathematical fractals. Featuring original music, the show is both educational and highly entertaining, and suitable for audiences 3 and up. A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.

It’ll take me ten thousand years to understand it”: Some assembled theories on BOE, the Message, FTL, timing, and a myriad of spinning in place",TheNinthHouse,influencethis,2022-12-01 16:03:40,207,"Hello there! I have No Chill, and I started an annotated re-read of Nona almost as soon as I finished it the first time. I just finished my re-read, polished up my 60 pages (!!!!) of notes, and have some fresh new theories ready to put into the fandom space.  
 

A caveat to start off with: these are the interpretations of one lone fan. They are backed up by the text of Nona wherever possible, but still, I’m bound to get things wrong. Sometimes I’ll make some logical leaps; I’ll try to make clear why I made the jumps I did. I do not have full annotations for Gideon or Harrow, so my references will be spottier. These may come when I feel like them. If I make references to specific lines or paragraphs, I will cite where this appears in the hardcover English copy of Nona. I’ll also try to cite the chapter so that audiobook folks can figure out where to re-listen to it on their own.  
 

Also, I’ll be taking about the Angel and The Message/Aim in this post, and their pronouns are difficult to parse. I’ll explain more later, but I’ll be calling the Angel “she/her” as a singular person, and The Message/Aim “they/them” as a multiple person.

***Why wait a myriad?***  
 


In terms of plot, we know why we needed to wait 10,000 years for the events of the story to happen—because that’s when the story is taking place. Why Muir’s made **Jod** wait 10,000 years to wake up Alecto and start running out the clock on his mortality is less clear.  
 

Some of this is explained in the opening poem of the book.  
 

>You told me, *Sleep, I’ll wake you in the morning.* 

>I asked, *What is morning?* and you said, 

>*When everyone who fucked with me is dead.* 

> 

>*When everyone we loved has gone or fled,* 

>*That’s morning. Empty’s just another word for clean.* 

>*Let’s put this first-draft dream of mine to bed.* 

> 

>*In the appointed hour* 

>*I’ll pull up your sheets. I’ll kill the light,* 

>*Lie down beside you; die; and sleep the night.* 


What I initially took this to mean is that “When everyone we loved has gone or fled” was the key phrase—once he loses the ones he loved, he’s ready to die (a situation he found himself in starting off with the conclusion of HTN, and that he’s spiraling into hard in the events of NTN). But let’s instead critically examine the line “*When everyone who fucked with me is dead*”. This initially reads as “when everyone descended from the trillionaires is dead”, but then I found the line I named this post after. This line, I believe, gives us Jod’s motivation to start things 10,000 years after the fact, the reason the economy of the Houses makes no sense, and even some potential explanations for phenomena and character motivations. 

But first, let’s lay out what we know so far, my assumptions, and what lead me down this rabbit hole. 

---
***What was the trillionaire’s plan?*** 

This one is relatively easy to answer in broad strokes, because Jod tells us some of it directly in John 19:18. They used the existing space ships and were going to use them to go faster than light (FTL) to get to the Tau Ceti system 12 light-years away from Earth. 

Jod and his team see holes in this—namely, that once you approach the speed of light things get extremely weird relative to time and space. People in a spaceship traveling at a constant acceleration would live lives that are normal length, but to people outside of the ship, they would be traveling and living for thousands of years. This has been explored a lot in sci-fi, so you might be familiar with it; if you’re not, I’d recommend looking at Wikipedia if you want an explanation that is simple enough for me, a dummy, to understand: [faster-than-light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light) travel, [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation), and [space travel under constant acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_travel_under_constant_acceleration).

Jod says *“They said they found some dipshit geek who’d fixed the FTL problem of getting locked in the chrono well, you know, moving so fast you were stuck doing wheelies.”* (p 221) Physics geeks may have read this and instinctively got it, but I had to work to parse this out. I’m mostly sure that this means that FTL has the danger of traveling in *time* as well as in *space*: not just going so fast that you seem to live thousands of years, but going that fast *while also displacing time* so that those thousands of years may take half a second, or until the heat death of the universe, in the perspective of an outside viewer. To make it simpler, it might make more sense to say that FTL can break time—something that Jod himself mentioned happening in HTN. *“It’s the only way. Faster-than-light travel turned out to be a snare—the way it was originally cracked, anyway. The first method destroyed something to do with time and distance, rendering it unusable for any good purpose…”* (HTN ch 6)

The key to stopping this space-time break, Jod says, is *“something where you could oscillate out so long as the ship was attuned to a prearranged spectrum outside.”* (221, John 19:18) The announced plan is that one of the twelve evacuation ships will lead the rest with these beacon frequencies, similar to a tugboat, and lead them out of FTL. He adds that A— understood what they were saying, but Jod says  ***“I still don’t understand the maths. It’ll take me ten thousand years to understand it.”***

The phrasing of this is no coincidence. I think this is a breadcrumb left by Muir to help explain what the hell Jod’s been doing these last 10,000 years. 

Because of Jod killing off everyone and destroying the memories of his resurrected friends, he **has** to be the one to understand the math of FTL. The trillionaires are beyond his reach, in a broken time and space. Though he can travel 40 million light years to the Mithraeum, he can’t get to the trillionaires.

***Because the trillionaires haven’t come out of FTL yet. Jod holding back one ship changed the mathematics of their jump, and they’ve been in some kind of non-space for the last 10,000 years.*** The ship that he held back may still be in our space, which is why people know things from pre-Resurrection time. And the only way to get them out is in the Angel’s brain.

Yeah, that’s a lot to throw at you at once. But I have a decent amount of backup for my absurdity.

---
***Why assume that they’re stuck in time, instead of just somewhere out in the universe?*** 

There are a couple reasons, and I’ll be going through some of them. In terms of the information the book gives us directly, I think it’s important that Jod says that the trillionaire’s ships *“were gone...lost to me in time, forever.”* (410, John 1:20). We know that these John interludes are memories, but the current Jod pops in and gives commentary or more information throughout these replays, noted with quotation marks. So I think it’s really important to note he says “forever” here and doesn’t correct himself. Jod is *absolutely* the kind of guy to mention all the ways he’s won: leaving out how he’s found his mortal enemies is not his style. He reiterates his desire to get to the trillionaires in John 5:4, where he says, using quotation marks, *“Sometimes I think the only reason I haven’t done it already is that I can’t bear the idea that* ***I wouldn’t be able to touch them—that they’d still be out there...***” (435) (bolding mine). The only ones he’s not able to touch are people outside his empire, and the ones he wants to get to are the trillionaires. This line heavily implies that the trillionaires are still outside of his reach.

I also think his actions—described more than once by characters as being in stasis for 10,000 years—make more sense as someone waiting, rather than someone with all the pieces in play. Since he can travel 40 million light-years in a single River trip to the Mithraeum, it’s also incredibly unlikely that he wouldn’t have been able to find someone aiming for a measly 12 light-years from Earth.

But first, let’s address some of the theories this would affect.  

---
***Wait, didn’t we decide BOE are the descendants of trillionaires?***

Most of the fandom has! And I agree that they have information from pre-Resurrection time. Where we differ, though, is where we think the information comes from. But first, let’s start with the structure and the resources of BOE, and why I think it’s unlikely that they’re from a line of wealthy aristocrats.

Going into Nona, we had only scattered information on Blood of Eden. They’re an anti-House faction, they showed up about 5,000 years ago, Wake was a BOE leader, they had specialized naming practices, Wake refers to herself as the vengeance of the 10 billion that Jod killed, and Jod said of them “*how sharper than a serpent’s tooth, etc.”*, a reference to a line from King Lear’s “How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is/ to have a thankless child.”

Nona the Ninth is swimming in information about BOE. We see that they have a non-centralized power structure, consisting of multiple wings and cells that often fight, as with We Suffer’s Ctesiphon wing vs. Unjust Hope’s Merv wing. They can, however, communicate well enough to vote on large-scale decisions such as bombing the bunker where Ianthe-as-Babs is holed up. (295, Ch 20)

What we don’t get from BOE is a sense of a centralized, powerful political structure. The planet that the narrative takes place on, Ur (in BOE terms) or New Rho (in House terms) seems primarily beholden to the Houses, as referenced by the 700 year contract that Ur/New Rho planet was under. All other forms of governance are seen as resistance and lumped together by the populace, if the comments from the crowd after the broadcast are any indication. When the Angel describes Lemuria, the most she says is that in the resistance to the Houses, *“Blood of Eden was there, too, you know,”* (240, Ch 17) though this might be an attempt to minimize her familiarity with BOE. BOE even runs out of money and resources—see Ctesiphon wing housing all their high-value non-BOE people in a single location, the building where Nona lives.


BOE doesn’t seem to be an entity with much power or many resources—they instead look like a very organized resistance movement. The cell, wing, and distributed power structure certainly point to this, since they’re ways of clandestine organization. This system is designed to minimize losses in case a cell is lost and to obscure lines of power so that high-level leadership can’t be directly traced back to a cell’s actions. None of this is news, or unexpected on a planet ruled by the Houses. However, we don’t have much evidence that BOE has any planets of their own.

We also know BOE lacks knowledge of any faster-than-light travel outside of the ones developed by the Nine Houses. When the House shuttle containing Ianthe-as-Babs shows up, Pash mentions that they should have been able to spot it if it was sub-light-speed or if people were monitoring the stelae, and is explicitly told that the River is above her security clearance (154, Ch 12) No mention of any instantaneous travel was mentioned; in fact, the possibility of instant travel through the River was news to We Suffer (310, Ch 21). We also know BOE only got their hands on a stele when Mercymorn sets up the one in the Gorgon in [As Yet Unsent (AYU)](https://www.tor.com/2022/06/08/as-yet-unsent-tamsyn-muir/), which is set sometime during the events of Harrow the Ninth. So the knowledge that the trillionaires had about FTL travel does not seem to have been passed along to BOE. If they don’t have FTL travel, their range of inhabitable planets is limited to what they can get to in sub-light travel, which would make it suicidally easy for the Cohort to wipe them out if there were openly BOE-controlled. Given this, it is increasingly unlikely that BOE exists on planets that are controlled by their own organization. 

It’s also highly unlikely that they have large pools of resources, which would be strange if they’re descended from trillionaires who set out on their journey with *“everything converted into material resources”* (pg. 396, John 1:20). The nature of wealth is that having a lot of it makes it easier to get more of it—especially if the trillionaires brought their wealth in food crops or terraforming plans. If they started off on an Earth-like planet full of easy-to-grow food and working technology, you’d expect to see BOE swimming in resources and/or operating a colonization scheme of their own. Instead, they’re a scrappy resistance group.

---
***Okay, but they have all that Pre-Resurrection knowledge, though.***

We can infer that BOE had contact with trillionaires through some points:

* They know about the 10 billion, which the people of the Houses seem unaware of. 

* They have access to internet-like technologies that the Houses (outside of Lyctors) lack, which Jod explicitly stopped from developing, if we take his closing words from John 5:18 at face value.  

* They have sub-light-speed travel without relying on magic. 

* They use references in their names, both personal and structural, that refer to parts of the old Earth cultures.

* These references are somewhat divorced from context—Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” is considered as appropriate as Shakespeare to be named after. Categorical context is retained, though, in that BOE names their Lyctoral sources after legendary weapons and their cells after Earth cities.

The nature of this contact, though, is still unknown. Most fans have decided that they are descendants of the Earth trillionaires because of this clear contact with pre-House tech and knowledge. However, I would differ on this. All we have evidence of is that BOE has **access** to information from pre-Resurrection times. This information doesn’t seem to be filtered or watered down in the way that stories are through generations of telling and re-telling—it seems like it’s fresh from the source. Which may indicate that the information is coming from records, not from living memory.

Do I have stronger evidence than this? Nope! But the clarity of the information is unlikely to have been retained so well after such a long time. I mean, [Australian Aboriginal peoples have fantastically detailed and incredibly preserved oral traditions](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/16/indigenous-australian-storytelling-records-sea-level-rises-over-millenia), but the methods for the care and keeping of those kinds of stories would be incredibly difficult to replicate in a scattered diaspora.

BOE internet-like tech and broadcast technologies are also not particularly advanced; they seem to be around the level that we have today. Wouldn’t descendants of trillionaires who took great amounts of the Earth’s material resources have developed more advanced technology than this? The state of their current technology might be explained if it’s all backwards-engineered from remains—remains of the one ship of the trillionaires that Jod held back. 

---
***Okay, let’s say I believe you. Then who’s living on the non-House planets?***

This is a tricky one to answer, because we only have Nona’s and Harrow’s perspective on this, and they are both way more involved with their own problems than those of the empire. Let’s assemble the facts we have.

We know there are planets that aren’t involved in the Nine Houses in any way, since Jod talks about *“people we encounter outside the Nine Houses”* in HTN. (Chapter 14, p 154 in hardcover) Granted, believing this means believing Jod about something, which I’m loathe to do, but the actions of the Cohort and the Lyctors would point to this being relatively accepted. I hate this, since it blows earlier theories of mine out of the water, but it seems to be factual. 

So where did these people come from? From the Jod chapters in Nona, we know of two prominent resettlement proposals: Jod’s and the trillionaires. Jod certainly focuses on the trillionaires to the point of distraction, but who’s to say that they’re the *only* ones making a rival plan? We know that there’s enough space travel to have settlements on Mars, Uranus, and a Kuiper platform—what are the odds that someone with ships that were capable of travel to these settlements might have just taken off when the writing was on the wall? This also doesn’t take into account that, in a world where space travel is more common, any university with an engineering and/or physics department would be full of scientists making small ships during *normal* times. In extreme times, do you think that excitable students freshly full of space knowledge would wait until they got all the protocols right? No, they probably scooped up friends and family and went on a voyage into the unknown. Probably a few of them succeeded. 

We know there was a year between Jod’s team breaking the news that the environment wouldn’t recover and the killing of the 10 billion. A lot can happen in a year, including using sub-luminal speeds to get out of the Sol system. Space travel under constant acceleration could lead them to finding new, habitable planets in a few years to them/a few thousand to outside observers. 

I have few doubts that there were a bunch of small launches all over the world that Jod didn’t pay attention to because they weren’t big and bombastic. His whole MO is that he wants large-scale praise and recognition. Even before his ships were reused by the rich, he basically gives up. If he can’t save *every* person *his* way, he discounts the plan.

---
***What happens to these shepherd planets?*** 

 
In [As Yet Unsent (AYU)](https://www.tor.com/2022/06/08/as-yet-unsent-tamsyn-muir/), non-House populations are considered separate and not accepted into Dominicus system, via Judith’s conversations with Corona: *“The princess told me that she had felt for a long time that the Cohort movements didn’t make sense to her. She said what would be most economically productive was intermingling with these people, allowing immigration and absorption into the Nine Houses.”* We also learn that people on shepherd planets sign contracts with Houses that expire on the Emperor’s death; when this means they’re beholden to him for generations, this causes political upheaval. 

We hear from the Angel that the situation on Lemuria was *“The usual. It had been under contract for a long time. I mean, we were the third settlement wave, they built the Crescent in the bones of two other cities, you couldn’t dig up anything without finding remnants of a people we’d never known.”* (p 240, Ch. 17) This indicates that shepherd planets are settled for a long time—long enough for them to develop into distinct societies of their own that live and die. It’s also notable that these are people who “we’d never known”, meaning the information about these societies never filtered back to the rest of the settled Empire.

Given these snippets, we can assume that these shepherd planets are maintained for hundreds, if not thousands, of years while they slowly wait to become uninhabitable, and the people on them never integrate into the Houses. They’re also operating at an economic and cultural loss. The Cohort is employed mainly to create shepherd planets, maintaining peace with those planets, and stopping those that fight back. But why? What does Jod get out of it?

---
***So why keep all these people around?*** 

Now, none of the settle-and-resettle-over-10,000 years plan makes sense if you’re trying to destroy your worst enemies. If non-House planets are full of trillionaires’ descendants, why wouldn’t Jod just send the Cohort in to kill them all? Why trap them in boring work contracts that mean he’s responsible for their safety and livelihoods?

It does make sense, though, ***as a way to eliminate places for your enemies to hide***. Finding and systematically destroying every habitable planet will eventually lead to having no place for humans to live. This is ideal if he's still waiting for the trillionaires to show up: once they get out of the no-space they find themselves in, they’d have no choice but to come to the Empire, i.e. Jod, to find somewhere to live. And he can finally kill them and die.

However, it also means that the rest of humanity will have nowhere to live when you run out of habitable planets. This is a situation we find ourselves in during Nona—it looks like humanity outside of the Dominicus system is confined to three planets, and relocation plans don’t seem to be coming. That means that the end for humans outside of the Houses is bleak, and due to the sharp decline in birthrates within the Houses, it looks like the whole human race is slowly winding down. 

If you assume that Jod views the non-House people as disposable pawns for his endgame, his policy starts to cohere a little more. He extracts knowledge and resources from these planets to help feed and enrich his favorites, i.e. the Nine Houses, and moves these pawns to any other habitable planet once the one they’re on dies. The people are just there to let him know when a planet is dead. Their conquest and rebellions also serve to keep his military trained and ready to fight for when his real enemies show up. 

---
***Okay, so what’s all this about remains?*** 

What if, during one of these many relocations and excavations, people found a ship that was older than known time? What if that ship was the one that Jod held back and killed? We already know that there’s an underground movement of teaching sciences, as the Angel says about her college days: *“I went to the special zoology school on Miro and attended a heap of underground archeology talks. I was a youthful firebrand. Political, you know.”* (p 251, Ch 18) The reason that archeology might have been driven to underground talks may have been because someone found these old Earth things and realized the extent to which they were being lied to by House propaganda. 

Consider also that the Houses didn’t jump into the fight at Lemuria until the population started to fight back against the mutated animals using old materiel. What if that’s what triggers the Cohort: not the flip to thanergy, but the evidence that people have done *archeology*? **What if one of the purposes of the Cohort is to destroy evidence that might contain old Earth information?** 

In that light, the meaning behind Jod’s quoting “how sharper than a serpent’s tooth” is personal. His estranged children—the ones outside of the seat of the Empire—have found information about him and turned against him. 

---
***Are you going to come back to The Message?*** 

Of course! First, let’s talk about the Angel and what we know, and what we can assume. 

We know that the Angel has an implant somewhere in her body (p 252). She’s referred to as the continuity of BOE (312) and as having millions of bosses (246). The Angel also enjoys being called “she” and “her” by people not in BOE, is called “they” and “them” by the BOE, and refers to herself as “we” and “us” when describing the Message to Nona, though the Angel has to correct herself on using the “I” pronoun: *“But I exist,” said the Angel. “Pardon—* we *exist. And as long as we exist, we are a terrible liability.”* (426, ch 29). Pash teases the Angel about wanting to have some “independent living for once” (215, Ch 16), but the Angel talks about how much of a privilege it is to be “they”. The message is within the Angel, and the message is called Aim, which was passed down from Emma Sen. (427, Ch 29) 

From this, we can assume that the person who now carries Aim is a singular person (we’ll call her the Angel for simplicity’s sake), but carrying the Message confers upon the bearer the status of being multiple people. Given that the Angel mis-counts herself by using “I” instead of “we”, we may also assume that the Angel was a singular person for longer than she has been Aim. We can also assume that having this implant grants the bearer an extremely high status—Aim is given priority on leaving Ur, is considered the lifeblood of BOE, has a personal bodyguard in Pash whose job is considered a huge privilege, can order wing commanders around at their will, and is considered so valuable that any weapon discharged around them is a death sentence for its bearer. It is both a large responsibility and a privilege to be given this implant; Aim orders themselves into uncertainty to spare We Suffer the responsibility of looking after them. 

What is so valuable that it trumps the existence of nearly every other person? What can be so simple it can’t be understood by Nona and Aim, but so powerful that it precedes nearly every BOE protocol?

---
***The Message might be the way the trillionaires are getting out of FTL.*** 

We know that the FTL plan involved a set of tugboat-ships sent out before the FTL ships to guide them safely out of FTL jumps. We know that some tugboats made it, since Jod says on John 1:20 on page 409 that *“By that point a couple of tugs had already launched through the Kuiper. [….] I reached...they blinked away from me”* (409, John 1:20). Assuming he’s not lying, that means that some tugboats made it into FTL-jump-space. He also emphasizes that he only held one ship in his hands before they all *“were gone...lost to me in time, forever.”* (410, John 1:20). 

Something about this action made the mathematics for FTL go wrong. Either this ship that Jod grabbed was killed and thus wasn’t in the jump, or it made the jump and maneuvered wrong enough that it sidetracks all progress. Even the kind of FTL that we’re familiar with, the River, requires advanced mathematics that are extremely unreliable—Juno Zeta says that *“I did an initial calculation, but of course, the basic mathematics* can’t *be relied upon”* (p 417, Ch. 17) when talking about the calculations to get to the Ninth from Ur. So that would mean the advanced mathematics involved in getting out of FTL, which assumed that 12 ships were in the jump, are now completely wrong, trapping the ships in their non-space forever.

I’ve postulated that Jod is using his 10,000 years to figure out exactly when and where the trillionaires are, to wrench them out of their jump and to kill them all. But maybe *his brain* isn’t the only thing working on it. 

Let’s assume that he killed everyone and everything on the trillionaire ship with his new Jod powers. This ship is still moving through space, just because there’s no friction on it to slow it down. This moving object may crash onto an earth-like planet, or it may be just drifting into nothingness. Either way, it’s an object that is older than recorded time—something that any scientist or necromancer would be eager to get their hands on. If said scientist/necromancer finds this ship, they poke and prod everything and get all the data they can out of it. 

This data becomes an object of study before Jod can put a kibosh on it, and someone (maybe even a Lyctor?) cracks access to the digital files and reads what’s on them. Maybe these records end up in BOE hands, including some of the mathematics used to figure out the FTL jump. Someone’s clever enough to see that the equations are wrong, and to work on a solution to correct them. But the solution is incredibly complex—it'd take more than one human lifetime to work it out. 

**EDIT: The following section is no longer what I believe the history of the implant to be. For more on that, see my [post on Cassiopeia](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNinthHouse/comments/10kkxbk/theory_cassiopeia_boe_and_the_implant_a_wild). I'll leave this text here for posterity and to make the comments make sense, but I'm striking it out since I no longer support it.**

~~So this person finds a way to continue working on it after they’ve died. Not the typical House way, which would be to turn oneself into a construct and work on it for all time. No, they’re going to keep a small amount of their knowledge and brain power going in an implant. This implant will be taken from this person when they find someone clever enough to take the implant over from them. This second person will contribute a little of their brain power and their knowledge, and be able to converse with the impression of the first person if they have a disagreement. The second person finds a third person, the third finds a fourth, etc. Consider this chain of implant-bearers continuing for a few thousand years, and you’d have a crowd-sourced and independently-tested solution (well, as independent as “dead people living inside you” can be) that could take a few thousand years faster than Jod.~~

We know that there are two halves of The Message. We know that one half lives in The Angel. But they don’t mention the other half. ***I believe that the easiest way to explain this is that the half of the Message they don’t have is the one contained on the trillionaire’s ships.*** 

---
***What does this mean for Alecto the Ninth?*** 


Honestly, I have no idea. I was just proud of myself for piecing this one together. 

More seriously, I think this establishes the stakes and the motivations behind the Empire, and why Jod is content to let it crumble in the name of wiping out people that no one but him remembers. It also provides a bit more context for Jod’s behavior and might help plot a path for Aim’s motivations. Who knows, maybe the trillionaires will pop out of FTL halfway through the events of Alecto and just cause a shitload of chaos."

585,44,zw7xet,Juno College,What Evangelion is for me: a long-ass review from a relatively newer fan.,evangelion,JetPackFuture104,2022-12-27 00:39:53,13,"WARNING: I talk. A lot. So get some popcorn and Orange Juice or something idk I stay on reddit too long lol. 

And of course: *personal opinions*. This is Evangelion where literally no one can agree on anything (thanks Codex Entry), so don’t feel discouraged to disagree with whatever I say as long as you’re not a dick about it. If you’re going to, ironically, just try to be sensible. As the title implies, I’m a newer fan, and have basically pooled the last 7 or so months of my life into this franchise. To the point where I have to find *some* sort of closure any way I can, and I figured just letting myself go typing what this little anime now means to me was what I feel is the best I can do for it. So I would still really like hearing a lot of different takes and input from my fellow Kensukes. 

And also also….this is going to get pretty autobiographical and a bit heavy, so yeah. Also also also, I repeat myself a lot. There’s something poetic in there I’m sure (a StOrY tHaT rEpEaTs). 

(initiate rambling…)

**Come for the Robots. Leave with the life-changingness**

(note: the first several paragraphs are a copypasta of another post I did a while back about coming to terms with Eva. Just with some updated edits. The second half is all new).  

So: back in May of this year, I watched Neon Genesis Evangelion on Netflix (I watched it dubbed and I thought it was alright, don't @ me. At least it's a faithful translation so I can quote it in case. They got Venom to voice Kensuke so I can’t complain). I never got around to watching, or really getting *into* anime up until that point. I mean yeah, my mom showed me some Spanish dubs of Heidi and Candy Candy that she grew up watching, but other than that, anime just never really seemed to be a genre/medium I really gravitated towards. I didn't despise it or anything, I just never really immersed myself into it. Compared to my friends and peers who seemed to have it all figured out. Apparently, you really don't have much of an excuse to not check out anime in the present day thanks to stuff like the internet, streaming, (\*\*cough cough pirating cough\*\*), etc. Back then you had your VHS tapes and oversized DVDs called laserdiscs, and be stuck with either a crappy dub or sub. At least in the West of course. Up until this year, I only got into non-animes like Avatar: TLA & TLOK. 

So this year, I decided to really give it a go and find *anything* that would interest me. I stan the King of the Monsters himself (since this the EVA sub, naturally, I thought Shin Godzilla was incredible), so I watched that Singular Point series (apparently the Godzilla Earth anime trilogy isn't really that great), spent the summer checking out some Ghibli films, got around to Satoshi Kon (Millennium Actress is a straight-up masterpiece), and the two most recent series I finished were Toradora! (it didn’t truly get going for me until episode 16), and good ol' Saiki K. (one of the most endlessly rewatchable and consistently hysterical shows I've ever seen). I've already got a rough plan-out of stuff I want to watch up until I graduate college (I have my eyes set on Cowboy Bebop and Gurren Lagann for next year, with Fullmetal Alchemist (original and Brotherhood), Code Geass and I guess also Attack on Titan being the other big ones in terms of what I’ve heard about them. I have those set for 2024 onwards. I schedule a lot).

But *nothing* I mentioned above comes CLOSE to the force of art that was/is Evangelion (except maybe Akira, but like, on a *personal* level nothing's come close). I’m only an entry-level weeb and THIS was one of the first things I got into?! Not only is it a certified pop-culture phenomenon that's basically become Japan's very own Star Wars in terms of success, but it all came from a man who was stuck in a mental rut for several years. It goes without saying at this point but Hideaki Anno in a way *is* Evangelion. Not to discredit the other great artists who helped bring EVA to life (one of my personal favorite episodes is ep. 4, which Anno didn't even write, and brought up a lot of the signature psychological and minimalist stuff before he even decided to switch gears and fully commit to it by ep. 14-16), alongside the Sadamoto manga, suggestions of the VAs and animators, etc. Even in any auteurship, there’s still a level of collaboration that makes it come together in the end. But despite all that, it's a franchise that's become so intertwined, anchored and synonymous with its creator that you simply *can't* ignore it, compared to so many other works. I’ve had to read and hear the name “Hideaki Anno” more than I’d ever imagine. Just imagining myself telling a younger me that some depressed asian geek would create one of the most important pieces of media you’ll ever get the chance to experience. 

EVA ended up becoming a relentlessly personal thing for him throughout. A ""critique of otaku"" despite him still being a huge geek. A ""mecha deconstruction"" despite how that's been refuted over the years. An expression of the deepest darkest parts of personal human struggle. Living, existing, relationships, sex, self vs. others-all leading up to some themes and messages about good ol' fashioned mental illness. Going beyond just being ""another show about cool giant robots beating the shit out of Kaijus."" It's cranial, it's unsettling, it purposely doesn't care about its own lore (something that the Rebuilds especially will REALLY test you on), it's sobering, it hurts, it’s cathartic, it’s morbid, it’s humbling, it's unique. Crushingly depressing, but still reassuring and hopeful. It wishes for you to come to your own damn opinions about it and not get caught up in the coolness factor too much. Arguably more inspirational than it was inspired.

The original run of NGE & EOE was monumental enough as it was, in both how hugely it was received both good and bad. The bad of course seeming to outshine the good, specifically towards its original ending. Yeah it managed to positively touch some people in what it wanted to say, but it also unfortunately garnered a lot of stinging salt from people who genuinely felt f\*\*ked over by it, only to resort to telling a bunch of people you’ve never even met or know to unalive themselves just because you didn’t like some TV show they did. And even if most of the reception is warm, welcoming praise, one little simple ""go to hell you p.o.s."" can drag you down harder than anything else. One little piece of negativity and doubt just becomes a splinter in your brain you just can’t let go. 

Nowadays, NGE is considered a true 90s classic, and for that matter, an artistic triumph in general. Both critically, and not even touching commercially/financially. Divisive as it can be at times, there’s just *something* about this goddamn beast of a franchise that struck a nerve with everyone. You watch it once, and chances are-you’re not the same. And due to the huge exposure that dreams are made of, it becomes pop culture emergency whenever anything new happens. And it’s not exactly a surprise that EVA’s success story is a huge double-edged sword. Probably my favorite comment on reddit regarding this is from u/fessvssvm. They basically said (regarding EOE specifically, but I’d say you could apply it to everything else), how it changed their life for better and worse. And by worse- “It's just that the series's history, production, influences, creator, fans, merchandise, cultural legacy, and meaning are to me such vast issues that I felt the need to say ""and worse."" It's a whole lot to consider, especially when you have other things you must attend to.” Can’t really agree more with that the more I sit to think on it. (I mean, this is the goddamn internet after all. Reddit no less-the designated site for smartasses). 

Needless to say, in just several months or so, EVA has since managed to become one of my new favorite, or at the very least most important, pieces of art I've had the chance to experience. And given the religious (intentional or not) and mental aspects it has-I kind of feel blessed I got to see it. Yeah, most of the religious imagery and stuff was just added in for the coolness factor (which hey, can’t argue with that), but it still gives me a warm connection in some way. Intended or not. Heck, before I watched EOE and 3.0+1.0 for the first times, I prayed that they would be meaningful experiences. That’s how much this franchise grew to mean to me. EOE ended up becoming a film that changed my life, and that first watch will always be one of the most special film experiences for me. And while 3.0+1.0 was no EOE, or even episode 26 for that matter-by the end, as the credits rolled, I couldn’t help but think: “Yeah. That’s Evangelion.” It definitely feels like an ending only Eva would end up doing. I give a lot of credit for how ambitious it ended up being as a spiritual finale to one of the biggest anime of all time. Cathartic to the end(s). 

But back to the religious aspect, I was raised by fairly diehard Catholic parents. My whole life, that was just my whole world at times. I do still consider myself Catholic or at least religious, but don’t think for a second I haven’t had my doubts and trials. The existential horror, the weight of it all, the hypocrisies, destiny vs. choice, what religion in general can do to  a person, the fear of what lies ahead, what your parents expect/wish out of you, “you don’t get a choice,” do this, do that….it ain’t fun. The most religious and fulfillingly spiritual I’ve ever been was when it came naturally. No one forced me, I drove into it myself. It wasn’t and still isn’t easy, but I don’t deny that I did manage to feel closer spiritually on occasions when I really did just open myself up and talk to someone. Even if that someone is some maddeningly, unfathomable all-powerful guy-thing that I juggle between knowing whether I believe or don’t. At the very least, I like the idea of God. Someone to talk to, the only other person who knows you better than you, someone who knows all, can do all, the ultimate forever being. Of course, him existing I think shouldn’t be some excuse or cop-out either. He gave humans the curse of choice. There’s a ton of people out there who don’t believe in him and live perfectly fine. Great even. Something I’m sure of. And I seriously doubt he goes around just deciding on who to damn to hell on a whim just because they don’t believe in him. To me, it’s kinda like “it’s not what I think. It’s what you think.” Kinda like Shinji’s ultimate choice in EOE. It may have all been planned to some degree (because of Yui’s motives and whatnot). But it’s *still his choice*. It was still all his call. And that to me is what makes it so powerful. He may not have known it, but that doesn’t matter. As much as it kinda pains me to admit it, by the end of it all, it was still an honest decision he had to come to. At least it’s genuine. At least it was real. I can deal with that. And above all else, I’m willing to appreciate that. Yes, life is a piece of shit. The biggest raw deal you’ll ever get. But damn, you’re really willing to go back to it? Well, yeah I guess. It will hurt, I will have to go back to the suckiness again. But maybe there’s some way I can embrace it? And like in episode 26, it all becomes a matter of perspective. Reality hinges on how you, as an individual, view it. What you see in everyone and everything makes up your reality. You can’t necessarily alter it like some god, but even with the necessary restrictions of life that keep you from gaining absolute freedom; the little but important freedoms and choice you do have should be cherished. It’s a holy balance. Will it be easy? Fuck no. But don’t use it as an excuse either. At least give it a shot. 

I still don’t know, but I’ll keep looking. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to keep pushing through, even if I never find anything. It’s not cool, but with what little, bottom-of-the-barrel scrapings you have and are as a person are…there has to be something. Even at your absolute lowest, what will keep you from ending it all besides the physical pain? What can keep you going? It’s a start. A reset. A second chance. Shinji decides to give all of humanity a sacred second chance. If you do get a second chance: don’t waste it. You’ve gone through your journey of accepting yourself and others: now’s your moment. Show us what you got. You may not deserve it or need it, but you have it. Once you get it, make sure that by the end, you HAVE earned it. And unfortunately, as we see in the I Need You epilogue, real life continues to be full of good and bad. Shinji continues trying to choke out someone else. He just does it. To the one person who he’s grown to resent. And what does she do? She caresses him. She shows some affection. Not much, but she gives it a shot. And this little caress destroys him. Loosening his grip, he just can’t help but break down and sob like a bitch one last time. I can only imagine him saying in his mind “Sorry, sorry, sorry! Fuck me! I don’t know! Just, sorry. I’m sorry. Sorry. Sorry…sorry….sorry….”  Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion is the absolute mother of bittersweet endings. 

Feelings are a funny little thing God made ain’t it?

I’ve had a fair share of anxiety. Just stuffing my face into a pillow after an otherwise petty fight I’d probably get over in time anyway. If only dying didn't hurt. Just let me die. It would be better if I just never existed. It’d be for the best. For everyone. Mental illness is not fun. It would be better if you didn’t have to feel like this at all. No one really should have to. Worse still, you’re tempted to end it all over something that feels insignificant and petty. What would that really solve? To some extent: things may be better if it never happened. If *I* never happened. But I’m here now. Maybe I could find something meaningful and anything to like and appreciate in life. Appreciate…my new favorite word. I can appreciate things. Not necessarily like them, but try to find some sort of important side to it. It may not be what I wanted, but maybe what I needed. It’s OK to just live. To just be here. Live with yourself. Come to terms with yourself first and foremost. Accept yourself. And once you got that down, then you can start paying it forward with others. Don’t give up on others, but not on yourself either.  

(takes a deep breath to reel it all in one last time)

So where was I? Oh yeah, giant colorful robots. I finished a big rewatch of all 26 episodes and End of Evangelion last month (Gkids blu-ray, and yes, I’m sorry my initiation didn’t involve Fly me to the Moon like everyone else’s did. Great renditions and all (the Acid Bossa Nova version is my personal favorite) but I kinda also like the haunting renditions of Rei’s theme for the credits too). I’ve also now watched all 4 Rebuilds too (First with Funimation and for my rewatch, Amazon. And I actually *like* the Amazon dubs. Yeah they’re not that great and all, but come on, it’s not like it’s Kimba dub quality either. That's a hill I'll die on). Started the Sadamoto manga a while back, and I’ll see if I can finish them in time to review them before the year’s up (yeah, I know, I’m strapped for time). 

Finally, I just want to say I was originally going to review episode-by-episode style, but I just want to get these over with and really let myself go by the end of the year. Plus, that’ll hopefully save you all some time instead of having to hear me drone on way longer than I have to. Maybe I’ll save a more in-depth analysis of sorts for another day, but for now: I’m glad I let myself go. Just get stuff off my chest about what I view and appreciate from this powerhouse of a franchise. What it means to me personally. Honestly, the best analyses/interpretations of EVA (or at least my favorites), are the ones where they take a more personal approach. What it means to others, and how they were touched by it. 

In short, this is a franchise that after devoting 8 months of my life browsing the internet, reading this sub, watching whatever video essays I can find, pondering, wondering, contemplating, repeating, going back-and-forth, splitting my head over, reevaluating myself, reevaluating others, applying it to my life, etc. etc. etc. (d e e p  b r e a t h).......   I just HAD to make something out of it. 

Like the series itself: it’s not really declarative. It’s about coming to terms with life. Maybe you’ll never find an answer. Maybe you won’t even like it. But. it’s. *Life.* Life sucks. A lot. But that doesn’t mean it’s all over either. That doesn’t mean you should just give up either. 

I mean that’s basically THE simplest, easiest, obvious as balls message of Evangelion. Hell, most if not all of EVA’s morals are pretty simple, cliche things we’re told. “Believe in yourself,” “Don’t be selfish,” “Care about others,” “don’t give up…” And yet for many people, this franchise about giant robots managed to take the most annoyingly cliche life lessons into morals that *actually* stick with you. That hurt you out of love. That can motivate you. That actually leave you *floored.* Thanks in no small part to *how* they’re told. If you can take already important and genuinely important advice about life and translate it through ways that are fresh, nuanced, and just so *honest*, all the more stemming from a guy who's been down that piece of shit road that is mental illness-then that’s just a damn triumph in it of itself. I truly can’t stress enough how sometimes, words just cannot describe how much Evangelion grew to mean to me. For all its faults, I have no regrets. I’m going to have a really rough time trying to forget about this franchise. Megumis, Tsurumaki, Sadamoto, the anime industry, geeks, friends, family, everyone, and last and certainly not least you, Hideaki Anno…you absolute beautiful *bastards,* you. 

So yeah, I’ll see if I do some quick reviews of NGE, EOE, the Rebuilds, and the manga over this week. I promise they won’t be as drawn out and dreary as this post was. But I am honestly more than glad I decided on making a post like this. I feel it finally does justice what EVA means for me, and by all accounts, I feel is probably the hardest part of it all. My actual reviews will hopefully be more condensed and approachable, and I would like if they spark discussion. 

But as I’m typing all this down-as rash and as off the top of my head as they are-I wouldn’t mind being more than content having this be my “definitive” EVA post. 

Until then: I really do mean it when I say thank you to whoever read through this whole thing. Take care. Sincerely, thank you. 

PS: This is sort of extraneous, but my favorite song to listen to after finishing The End of Evangelion is a song called ""Call and Answer"" by none other than friggin' Barenaked Ladies (specifically the live version in 2009, which was Steven Page's last performance with them before the Juno reunion in 2018. Youtube it). With 3.0+1.0, it's ""23"" by Jimmy Eat World. 

Shinji is one of the greatest protagonists of all time. Rei is better than Asuka. Misato reserves the title of best lady. Kensuke Aida is my dreamgirl. PenPen is love. PenPen is life. Save the Whales. Byyyyyeeeeeee........=)."

Download Movie Avatar 2: The Way of Water One of the movie streaming industry’s largest impacts has been on the DVD industry, which effectively met its demise with the mass popularization of online content. The rise of media streaming has caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies such as Blockbuster. In July 2015 an article from the New York Times published an article about Netflix’s DVD services. It stated that Netflix is continuing their DVD services with 5.3 million subscribers, which is a significant drop from the previous year. On the other hand, their streaming services have 65 million members. In a March 2016 study assessing the “Impact of Movie Streaming over traditional DVD Movie Rental” it was found that respondents do not purchase DVD movies nearly as much anymore, if ever, as streaming has taken over the market. Watch Movie Avatar 2: The Way of Water , viewers did not find movie quality to be significantly different between DVD and online streaming. Issues that respondents believed needed improvement with movie streaming included functions of fast forwarding or rewinding, as well as search functions. The article highlights that the quality of movie streaming as an industry will only increase in time, as advertising revenue continues to soar on a yearly basis throughout the industry, providing incentive for quality content production.

Avatar 2: The Way of Water Movie Online Blu-ray or Bluray rips are encoded directly from the Blu-ray disc to 1080p or 720p (depending on disc source), and use the x264 codec. They can be ripped from BD25 or BD50 discs (or UHD Blu-ray at higher resolutions). BDRips are from a Blu-ray disc and encoded to a lower resolution from its source (i.e. 1080p to 720p/576p/480p). A BRRip is an already encoded video at an HD resolution (usually 1080p) that is then transcoded to a SD resolution. Avatar 2: The Way of Water Movie BD/BRRip in DVDRip resolution looks better, regardless, because the encode is from a higher quality source. BRRips are only from an HD resolution to a SD resolution whereas BDRips can go from 2160p to 1080p, etc as long as they go downward in resolution of the source disc. Avatar 2: The Way of Water Movie FullBDRip is not a transcode and can fluxate downward for encoding, but BRRip can only go down to SD resolutions as they are transcoded. BD/BRRips in DVDRip resolutions can vary between XviD or x264 codecs (commonly 700 MB and 1.5 GB in size as well as larger DVD5 or DVD9: 4.5 GB or 8.4GB), size fluctuates depending on length and quality of releases, but the higher the size the more likely they use the x264 codec.

◇ COPYRIGHT ◇ Copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States. Some jurisdictions require “fixing” copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. \[better source needed\] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution. Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered “territorial rights”. This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction.

◇ MOVIES / FILM ◇ Movies, or films, are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or teach people something. Most people watch (view) movies as a type of entertainment or a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid. It is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity. However, Parc argues that contrary to prevailing beliefs, imitation and copying do not restrict cultural creativity or diversity but in fact support them further. This argument has been supported by many examples such as Millet and Van Gogh, Picasso, Manet, and Monet, etc. Most movies are made so that they can be shown on screen in Cinemas and at home. After movies are shown in Cinemas for a period of a few weeks or months, they may be marketed through several other medias. They are shown on pay television or cable television, and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. You can also download or stream movies.

590,49,zko5d4,Juno College,"Some evangelical couple called my soundtrack ""Unnatural and Satanic"" XD",WitchesVsPatriarchy,CooperHChurch427,2022-12-13 01:02:03,29,"I am absolutely laughing at this. So my college at the end of the year hosts a Short Film Competition where Students at the college can submit a short film. My friend and his friends made a SCP short film and needed a soundtrack at the last minute, so they asked if I could supply some of my songs. I gave them my entire catalogue and they picked out a few. Now one of my songs, admittedly has a weird quirk where if played in a room with not enough padding can produce infrasound's, it's unintentional but kind hilarious because it's a weird off-putting song as is, so when in the right environment it makes you feel nervous and uneasy because it generates sounds below what humans can hear.

Well at the end of the competition my friends short film won for ""Best Cinematography"". ""Best Original Plot"" and surprisingly ""Best Original Soundtrack"" and at the end some guy and his wife came up, and began attacking them for having an unnatural and satanic soundtrack. Now one of my friends used to be part of a local evangelical church and recognized the couple. He had to explain to them that it was a girl who wrote it and worked within the limitations of a set-up as it was a single person writing and recording it. 

Then it became misogynistic and proposed that my friend go marry me and tell me how to make music that celebrates God and is real. What's funny about the situation is that I have some classical music training and a lot of music theory under my belt. Along with that, my friend is Gay, has a husband and has two kids. Plus, my two cousins have helped me refine my music, one is a music producer out in LA and NYC, and the other is a Pulitzer Prize Winner (and hopefully a Grammy winner soon). My cousin out in LA uses some of my synthesizer patches I developed on the DX7 and Juno-6 and Prophet-V synthesizers with a local musician near me. 

So yeah, apparently, I don't know how to make real music. While not witchy, I can't believe that I have done this, and I think it's weird how a evangelical couple found it satanic. My friends short had satanism and super natural things all over the place. 

As an FYI here are the soundtracks that won!

**Jesse Cook - Gravity:**  
Jesse Cook is a Canadian guitarist. He is a Juno Award winner, Acoustic Guitar Player's Choice Award silver winner in the Flamenco Category, and a three-time winner of the Canadian Smooth Jazz award for Guitarist of the Year. Cook studied in classical and jazz guitar at Canada's Royal Conservatory of Music, York University, and Berklee College of Music in the United States, he later attempted to unlearn it all while immersing himself in the oral traditions of gypsy music.

Gravity is the 2nd studio album release from Cook. 

**Opeth - Ghost Reveries:**  
Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal/rock band from Stockholm formed in 1990. Ghost Reveries is the eighth studio album by the band. 

""The Baying of the Hounds"" is partially inspired by lyrics from the song ""Diana"" from Comus's album First Utterance.

""Ghost of Perdition"" is included in the soundtrack for the video game Saints Row 2 on the radio station Krunch 106.66, and is available as a download for Rock Band 3. 

""The Grand Conjuration"" is included in the soundtrack for the video game Sleeping Dogs, on the radio station ""roadrunner records"". It is also included in the soundtrack for the video game Final Fight: Streetwise, being the boss battle theme song of one of the game's bosses, Famine.

Ghost Reveries received widespread acclaim upon release. Thom Jurek of AllMusic cited Ghost Reveries as a culmination of everything Opeth had worked towards throughout their career. Jurek defined the album as ""fully realized, stunningly beautiful, and emotionally fragmented; it's a terrain where power, tenderness, and sheer grief hold forth under heavy manners. Awesome."" Billboard described the album as delving further towards Opeth's progressive tendencies, commenting that the ""alternating between powerful metal bursts and gauzy atmospheres requires patient listening, but it allows for better exploration of the beautifully dark world Opeth creates."" Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork praised Opeth's diverse musical influences and instrumentation, as a blend of ""prog, jazz, stoner haze, blues-rock, Indian raga, pastoral tips, and acid-tinged freakers."" Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Loudwire placed the album at #3 on their ""Top 100 Hard Rock and Heavy Metal Albums of the 21st Century"" list, only being beaten out by System of a Down's Toxicity (#2) and Tool's Lateralus (#1)."

593,52,z2cjr4,Juno College,So...The Hera Standpoint Against Jasper Doesn't Make Any Sense [hoo] [toa],camphalfblood,Leoram1217,2022-11-22 21:17:22,26,"One of the most common, if not *the* most common arguments against the Jasper pairing is that Hera ""forced"" Piper and Jason together. This argument is invalid and makes no sense when closely examined in the text.

*The Wrath of Hera*

Ask yourself: If it was really Hera's grand plan to set her handsome champion Jason up with the hot bombshell that is Piper, and arrange a happy, perfect relationship between them that would eventually lead to marriage, why would Piper still be alive after deviating from Hera's plan?

Hera's wrath is legendary, after all. Mythology abounds with stories of Hera going far out of her way to lash out at those Zeus slept with. So many stories, in fact, that Hera is arguably the most wrathful and vengeful goddess of all, surpassed only by Nemesis, who is the goddess of revenge. More than just wrathful, though, Hera is also petty.

Let's look at Annabeth and the curse Hera placed on her for the disrespect she (Annabeth) showed her (Hera) at the end of Labyrinth.

From Ch. 20 of the book, Annabeth says,  '“Percy is right...you’re the one who doesn’t belong, Queen Hera. So next time, thanks…but no thanks.”'

And Hera's response, '“You will regret this insult, Annabeth. You will regret this very much.”'

This is what Hera considers to be an insult, and luckily for Annabeth, she's the main character in a children's story, and so she escapes any kind of serious punishment. Or does she? In Olympian, it is revealed to us just what Hera's curse is, and boy is it juvenile.

From Ch. 9,  ""Oh, yeah. Usually I don't see them, but the cows leave me little presents all over the place—in our backyard, on the sidewalk, in the school hallways. I have to be careful where I step.""

Manure.

Hera's curse upon Annabeth is that random piles of cow poop appear and she has to watch her step. Seems easy enough, but Annabeth's endeavors are met with limited results, as revealed in the short crossover, *The Staff of Serapis*.

""Finally, around four in the afternoon, \[Annabeth had\] trudged through Washington Square Park on her way to the subway station and stepped in a fresh pile of cow manure.""

The crossover takes place *after* the Giant War, so even after all the things Annabeth has done and been through, she is *still* cursed to step in cow dung.

Now, you're probably wondering where I'm going with this by now, because it just looks like I'm painting Hera as the most juvenile and petty goddess ever, which she kind of is, cursing a girl to step in poop, but let's take a moment to appreciate my previous points that Annabeth is a main character in a children's story.

Subtract one or both points, and Annabeth is *extremely* lucky that she wasn't outright turned into a cow and dropped into a pasture somewhere, and was forced to live the rest of her days as an animal, either being used as breeding stock, sold at auction, taken to a processing plant and butchered, or turned into a calf and forced to grow up as a cow and end up as described, or even Hera going all the way and turning Annabeth into a cow embryo and placing her inside a heifer to be completely reborn as a bovine...with all her human memories intact, so there's Annabeth, grazing through the pasture, praying to be rescued, and losing more and more hope every day because her prayers are never answered.

And then one day Camp Half-Blood receives a supply of the best beef it's ever had.

So, yes, Annabeth is extremely fortunate that she lives within a realm of mostly child-friendly stuff.

Admittedly, Hera's manure curse is not meant to be taken seriously. It's meant to be a humorous thing, a joke, something that makes you blow a rush of air out of your nose every time you read about it. The mental image is meant to make you laugh: ""Ha-ha! Annabeth stepped in cow poop!""

But in reality, Hera has actually ruined Annabeth's life.

Think about it: these manure piles appear *everywhere*, randomly. After the Giant War, Hera has *still* not lifted this curse, and probably never will, meaning for the rest of her life, Annabeth will be stuck keeping her eyes to the ground, keeping her wits about her to make sure she doesn't ruin her shoes and end up traipsing excrement wherever she goes. This will include such venues as college in New Rome, college in Berkeley, the dorms, and eventually the workplace, whether that be the office or the job site.

This may come as a shock to some of you, but poop is gross. It looks gross, smells gross, and is a serious health hazard. If Annabeth has an ""incident"" in New Rome, there will be sympathy, everyone feeling sorry for Annabeth...for the first time, stretch it to the third. Eventually, Annabeth's curse will become a nuisance. The stench in the halls, classroom, dorms, etc., the disgusting footprints she leaves in her wake--the Romans will get tired of it. They'll wonder why Annabeth hasn't made amends with Juno, why she hasn't appeased the goddess, and they may very well demand she does so in order to spare their noses and the health hazard Annabeth breeds with her curse.

Outside of New Rome, in Berkeley and wherever Annabeth works, there will be a tolerance of once. It'll be funny the first time like it is with everyone. ""Ha! You stepped in poop!"" Then after that, it'll become a *very* serious detriment to Annabeth's future. The people will be wondering how this young woman keeps stepping in manure and bringing it into the building. How much of a ditz is she that she can't watch where she steps? How irresponsible is she if she can't prevent herself from stepping in manure? Then, as stated, the obvious health hazard this is, bringing manure into a professional setting like a college and an office.

Annabeth could very well find herself expelled and/or *fired* because of Hera's curse causing her to have too many incidents that the deans/managers deem her to be a clutzy, disgusting, unsanitary, hazardous slob that can't keep her shoes clean because she can't pay attention to where she walks.

Hera's curse is meant to be something humorous, but it actually has very heavy, very serious implications behind it. The goddess could very well have destroyed Annabeth's life with this curse, all just because Annabeth threw some shade in her face about her skewed views of family.

Imagine, then, how much worse Hera's wrath against Piper would be if she really had intended for Piper to be Jason's wife, and instead Piper dumped him and effectively got him killed because his emotional state left him so mentally screwed that he couldn't beat that skinny twig of an emperor that couldn't take on an injured and exhausted Frank.

*The Mist Manipulation of Hera*

Why, exactly, did Hera give Leo and Piper Mist memories of Jason? The answer is simple: tactics.

Hera has been preparing for the Giant War over a decade in advance. She groomed Frank, Leo, and Jason, and the hand she had in Percy and Annabeth's affairs in Labyrinth can be taken as her trying to get them on her side. Bit of a stretch, yes, but it's clear Hera was making preparations for the war with Gaea. 

Why she didn't have any hand in Piper's childhood lies beyond the fourth wall, in that Uncle Rick didn't think about it, apparently.

Hazel, obviously, was dead at the time.

So why Piper, then? Well, again, beyond the fourth wall, Uncle Rick crafted the character of Piper because, if I recall correctly, one of his students, or a letter he received, said it would be cool if there was a Cherokee main character, and that's why we have Piper McLean, Cherokee Indian. Getting back within the constraints of the Fourth Wall, Piper was chosen by Hera because A) she's a demigod daughter of Aphrodite with charmspeak, necessary for the Prophecy of Seven, and B) the alternative is Drew Tanaka.

Because there apparently weren't any daughters of Venus that could charmspeak. 

Hera's decision to give Piper and Leo Mist memories was a *tactical* decision, not her playing matchmaker. For the prophecy about the dove and forge, it had to be Piper because there were zero alternatives, and Leo because he had the power of fire and the greatest engineering skills of all currently living children of Hephaestus/Vulcan. 

Remember: the Mist memories between the two are fuzzy and incoherent. Obviously a rush job on Hera's part, because if she really wanted to and had the time, she could've had all three thinking they'd practically been born and raised together. 

I want to digress for a moment here and talk about Leo. It's ironic to me how, at least as far as I have seen, that no one criticizes Leo and Jason's friendship. I have seen no one question the legitimacy of their bromance, or say anything about them being friends. If Jason and Piper aren't a legitimate romance because of the Mist, shouldn't Leo and Jason's friendship likewise be illegitimate? Where does one get a pass and the other does not?

Anyway, digression over.

Leo's memories of Jason are far less clear than Piper's, and the reason Piper's memories are so much more in focus is revealed by Aphrodite in Ch. 39 of Lost:

""'Because you are my daughter, Piper. You see possibilities much more vividly than others. You see what could be. And it still might be—don’t give up...'""

It was not Hera's intention that Piper fall in love with Jason due to the Mist. It was her intention with the Mist that Leo and Piper want to be Jason's companions for the quest because of the ""good times"" they'd all had together. Now, as for why Hera didn't give Jason any Mist memories, that's either because in her rush job with the former two she didn't have the time, Jason was too powerful to be deceived, or Uncle Rick thought it'd be more dramatic for Jason to have to deal with these two strangers that he'd never met before who insisted they'd known him for months.

Personally, I think the entire Jason/Piper/Leo situation is a powerful narrative about the heart, and following through with what you feel is right, but I digress again.

Canon supports that Hera had nothing with the Jasper romance because there is nothing in canon that says she had anything to do with their love. 

The first time Piper has any interaction with Hera is in her cabin when the goddess possesses Rachel, and demands that Piper free her. Not that Piper be a good girlfriend to Jason, but that she frees her. The second big interaction between them is at the Wolf House, where Hera reveals she chose Piper for her strength, and she says *nothing* about Piper and Jason's love and budding romance. The third big interaction is in Blood, on Ithaca, at the beginning of the book. Again, Hera has nothing to say about Piper and Jason's relationship.

She does get on a tangent about Odysseus, Penelope, and an olive tree and how they had a perfect marriage, but you really have to squint to see that as her trying to say something about Jasper. 

The fourth time Piper has an interaction with Hera is at the Acropolis, where, once again, no one says anything about her relationship with Jason. Hera features once more in Trials, but as I pointed out in my master essay, the breakup is never mentioned beyond Maze, and this holds true in Tower. Hera is in mourning for Jason, and has nothing to say about Piper breaking his heart. 

There is nothing in canon to support the notion that Hera arranged Piper's love with Jason. Her decision was based purely on tactics. It's all on Piper's power of sensing possibilities that she was able to see the Mist so clearly, unlike Leo who only had fuzzy memories. During her scenes, Hera says nothing about the pairing, neither promoting it nor condemning it. She shows no support, nor disdain. Hera *does not care* about Piper and Jason's relationship.

*Conclusion*

The argument that Hera forced Jason and Piper together is invalid. It makes no sense because there is no support behind it.

Hera chose Piper for the war because the prophecy she knew about beforehand regarding the dove dictated a child of the love goddess, and since there were no children of Venus present, and no sons had the power of charmspeak, it came down to Drew or Piper. The decision is obvious. Throughout Heroes, Hera has nothing to say about Piper and Jason's love. She's only concerned with the Seven succeeding in their quest. It should likewise be noted that where Hera says nothing about Jasper, she also says nothing about Percabeth, Frazel, or the budding Caleo. The queen of the gods is not concerned with romance in the slightest during this war.

Hera's wrath is legendary. In Annabeth's case, for minor, yet deserved, case of disrespect, the goddess has essentially destroyed her life thanks to the manure curse causing Annabeth untold future amounts of strife. If Hera ruined Annabeth's future for disrespect, her fury against Piper for defying her ""plans"" for her and Jason would've resulted in Piper's obliteration. Yet she lives, despite having ""defied"" the goddess, and has even thrown salt in Hera's eye by taking a girlfriend, which shatters the queen's idea of a ""perfect"" relationship. 

Hera had nothing to do with Jason and Piper. Their love for each other was all on them."

Contrary to popular GenX belief, the world didn't stop making music when you graduated high school in 1989, or when you graduated college in 1993. In fact, not only have people continued to make music, some of it is REALLY GOOD! For example: 

**Alvvays** (pronounced ""always"") is a Canadian indie pop band formed in 2011, originating from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and currently based in Toronto, Ontario. Their self-titled debut album, released in 2014, topped the US college charts. Their second studio album, *Antisocialites*, was released on September 8, 2017, and won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year in 2018. Both albums were short-listed for the Polaris Music Prize. Their third album, *Blue Rev*, was released on October 7, 2022, and is landing on several indie sites' ""Albums of the Year"" lists. Most notably (so far), Pitchfork readers voted it #5 album of 2022!

So have a listen!

**Jesse Cook - Gravity:**  
Jesse Cook is a Canadian guitarist. He is a Juno Award winner, Acoustic Guitar Player's Choice Award silver winner in the Flamenco Category, and a three-time winner of the Canadian Smooth Jazz award for Guitarist of the Year. Cook studied in classical and jazz guitar at Canada's Royal Conservatory of Music, York University, and Berklee College of Music in the United States, he later attempted to unlearn it all while immersing himself in the oral traditions of gypsy music.

Gravity is the 2nd studio album release from Cook. 

**Opeth - Ghost Reveries:**  
Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal/rock band from Stockholm formed in 1990. Ghost Reveries is the eighth studio album by the band. 

""The Baying of the Hounds"" is partially inspired by lyrics from the song ""Diana"" from Comus's album First Utterance.

""Ghost of Perdition"" is included in the soundtrack for the video game Saints Row 2 on the radio station Krunch 106.66, and is available as a download for Rock Band 3. 

""The Grand Conjuration"" is included in the soundtrack for the video game Sleeping Dogs, on the radio station ""roadrunner records"". It is also included in the soundtrack for the video game Final Fight: Streetwise, being the boss battle theme song of one of the game's bosses, Famine.

Ghost Reveries received widespread acclaim upon release. Thom Jurek of AllMusic cited Ghost Reveries as a culmination of everything Opeth had worked towards throughout their career. Jurek defined the album as ""fully realized, stunningly beautiful, and emotionally fragmented; it's a terrain where power, tenderness, and sheer grief hold forth under heavy manners. Awesome."" Billboard described the album as delving further towards Opeth's progressive tendencies, commenting that the ""alternating between powerful metal bursts and gauzy atmospheres requires patient listening, but it allows for better exploration of the beautifully dark world Opeth creates."" Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork praised Opeth's diverse musical influences and instrumentation, as a blend of ""prog, jazz, stoner haze, blues-rock, Indian raga, pastoral tips, and acid-tinged freakers."" Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Loudwire placed the album at #3 on their ""Top 100 Hard Rock and Heavy Metal Albums of the 21st Century"" list, only being beaten out by System of a Down's Toxicity (#2) and Tool's Lateralus (#1)."

The first part of the scheme is a boot camp style training so they are not looking for any particular skills but rather a passion for technology, willingness to learn and teamwork skills. That’s what I was trying to show with my CV, let me know what I could change.

I also included my LinkedIn links and my GitHub profile which has a read me file with more of a description of why I am interested in SE and has links to stuff like my code pen and other accounts.


I would really appreciate your help! It’s my first serious application so 😅"
602,61,10apof0,Juno College,going by a nickname?,gender,persimmonsprout,2023-01-13 03:48:05,2,"It's my first year in college and for the first time in my life I'm in surrounded by a predominantly queer community. I confronted my bisexuality for the first time by the first month of the first semester, which was a little bit scary but since then, I've cut my hair right above shoulder length and then to a pixie cut (it's a bit more grown out now, but still nothing I can use a hair tie on. I do like my hair like this, and luckily my grandparents and parents like it on me as well, but with no undertones of acknowledging my sexuality or perhaps slight gender confusion. I'm sure that it's because short hair on girls can in some cultures (such as in my family's culture) be almost infantilizing or demonstrative of a more innocent, young persona.

I started playing rugby this past semester and I really love the sport and moreover the community that it's gifted me with, and it's not uncommon that the we use nicknames for each other. My name has always been pretty grounding as it's a traditional female name in my culture but unique in the U.S.. As it's a bit ""foreign,"" my name doesn't necessarily have immediate feminine implications in the way a name like Ava or Julie might. I like that, but since listening to a lot of music from Juno (the movie soundtrack), I've actually grown to quite like Juno as a potential name that I may go by. I think it implies female but in a more muted and quiet way and if I went by it, I think I would have more personally significant associations with my name in that it is unique to the person I'm starting to discover/learn about in this chapter of my life.

But I also don't know if I'm being rash or impulsively trying to affirm the way I feel about myself in a way that I've only yet thought about for a few days. I would like to go by Juno, but I also don't want to feel like I've disregarded the name inherently tied to the self I've lived as for the past 18 years. I don't know what I'm asking for by typing this out but I just wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar, I guess."
603,62,zx2ov6,Juno College,should i get a dog? im 16,AskParents,Adventurous-Cress-75,2022-12-28 01:40:36,1,"i’m 16 and i’ve always wanted a dog, ever since i moved into my current house (we’ve lived here for almost 13 years now). i already had a small dog, but he was more of a family dog. i wanted a dog of my own. around the age of 7 i started to really ask for one. we ended up getting a dog, but it wasn’t really my dog— and the dog ended up going to my aunts house for a good year anyways. she eventually came back to live with us. she died recently, about a month ago. and the question came up— should we get another dog? my mom told me we would most likely get me a dog. and my dad said yes to the idea after me nagging him about it. but as i lay here watching dog videos to get me excited… should i get a dog? we planned to get the dog at the end of my junior year— which is only a semester away currently, so i could take care of the puppy over the summer, then i would be a senior. i would have less classes and, most likely no job, so i could be here for the puppy still even if she’s a bit older. then comes after senior year— i’m not going to a university immediately, but community college. would that take up a lot of my time? by then i MIGHT have a job, there’s no telling, but even then, i don’t see myself being there for the dog that much. she would be two by then.

in my home i live with my dad, mom, and two sisters (23 and 28). 28 will probably be moved out by then, same with 23 as she has plans with friends. parents both have jobs, dad longer than the mom but the mom has health issues that makes her easily tired (but also, mom might quit job by then lol.)

i feel stuck. i’ve wanted this dog for so long, it’s been my dream, but i don’t know if i’m fit for it. i’m scared i won’t give the dog the love it deserves.

(i plan for a golden retriever puppy, or some dog similar if that helps. i also have 4 cats, every time i asked for a dog i was given a cat. i love them.)

update: gonna get the dog. might name them juno or bowie :)"

605,64,zbfo6q,Juno College,My Veronaville R2,sims2,DramaticEnthusiasm71,2022-12-03 07:57:42,7,"Capp:

Consort has developed a close friendship with Ginger Newson. I play him as a secondary Family Aspiration, and love to imagine that he's a surrogate grandfather to the Newson clan. 

Per Hermia and Juliet’s rolled wants, I had the family adopt a puppy named Ajax. 

Tybalt has decided to move to college! I will play him along with anyone else that goes to college and share whether he passes or drops.

.

Monty:

Patrizio and Isabella are extremely in love. I am fighting to have them roll wants unrelated to one another. Given their LTW, I am going to have them adopt some children.

Romeo had a date with Mallory Mace, another Romance Sim and now has his 2 loves at once. 

Mercutio. . . Poor guy was in deep red. Either he was tantruming or complaining that he was smelly. I managed to knock him into gold for a positive grow up! 

No college for Mercutio. Instead, he’s having an affair with Trisha Traveller. 

.

Bianca. 

I had her marry the Townie, Jason Menen. Bianca struggled with having children. . . I think it was 4-5 tries for baby one? 

Together, the two have a little girl, Iris and son, Demetrius. We need a bigger house.

Jason is Vice President in Business due to chance cards. Bianca has not worked in forever but is a Cadet.

.

Summerdream:

Oberon rolled wants to have an affair with Isabella Monty. Given that his spouse was having an affair, though. . .

Titania? Poor thing is having a rough go, recovering. 

I forget pregnancies in Sims 2 can be difficult. Even with her baby born, her needs have been all over the place. 

Puck is my easy Sim. Just wants to be close with his dog, Benvolio and have him learn commands. 

Bottom aged up well into a Family Sim. 

Oberon and Titania have Celia together, a toddler. I forgot those things are nightmares to care for.

.

Gonreil & Albany:

I usually hate playing with Romance Sims. 

Miranda and Hal, though? I’m having so much fun! 

Miranda is dating another Romance Sim, Rebecca Shin. Hal surprised me by having chemistry with a Fortune Sim, Lora Hollmo. The main issue is that his sister is interested, too. . .

Desdemona aged up well into a Pleasure Sim! I usually avoid those Aspirations, too. I figured I should go for it, though. 

Gonreil had the easiest pregnancy of my game so far. She had a blonde little girl, Adrianna.

Really scared to see her age up. . .

Does anyone know the family’s hobbies? Driving me mad trying to figure it out. 

.

Antonio Monty:

I find them so boring to play right now. We are financially struggling and relying on whatever Beatrice can make off her pottery. I keep getting the ‘no longer a friend. . .’ notifications. We had a conversation less than 5 minutes ago, but sure. 

I did get them into private school. 

.

Cornall and Regan:

Reagan is now working in the science track! 

Diana learned every single toddler skill, which is rare. She grew up extremely well into a decent looking child and is very close with her parents.

I checked for curiosity sake and she has FULL nice and neat points! 

.

Kent:

I watched and he had no further desire to continue an affair with Titania. Began a relationship with and married Kaylnn Spitzig. 

She. . . Has chemistry with her father-in-law, too. They have fraternal twin girls, Audrey and Juno. 

Baby Marina has yet to age up.

.

Ottomas

Poor Peter lost his job. Upside? He can have more affairs. Downside? Even more downtime with his hideous and soul-sucking children. 

Titania and Jason were in the welcome wagon. I guess she hated him and decided to kick off a fight. 

In my initial play. . . I forgot to watch  Samantha's hunger, and she died in the bathroom. I tried having Dora and Peter beg for her to be saved. Her body was blocking the entrance, though. No one seemed overly concerned with her death and I was going to play on

Then Sharla woke up to sob over things. My guilt kicked in and I had to leave without saving. 

So. . . Samantha was alive in my second attempt and birthed girls (again. . . ). I forgot there was already a Diana and now we have Diana and Emilia. They are so ugly. Diana is so chiseled it it looks as though Consort or Nervous fathered her. 

Dora and David moved. I needed space and Dora wanted another grandchild.

I am hoping to extend her life and maybe get a romance with Consort Capp.

.

Newson: 

I play with the following mindset: in order for the children to stay together? Gavin and Ginger have to maintain passing grades with some form of income. 

Gavin is working as a school crossing guard. Upside? He has income and gaining skills is keeping him in a good mood. 

Issue is that he decided our house would look SO much better while burning. 

.

Picaso:

Jessica wants to have 10 children. I have never been able to reach this want with any Sim. 

Unsure whether it will count towards her 10 children. . . I had them adopt a little girl, Beth. They have. . . Hideous soul-sucking twin boys, Ross and Sebastian. Both inherited Matrhew’s ONE neatness point. 

.

Traveller:

Trisha tends to have attraction to Matthew Picaso in my other play throughs. I decided to go ahead and give her a secondary Romance Aspiration which has led to an affair with Mercutio Monty.

Wound up giving birth during her date with him. Poor Titus laid on the ground while his mum and her affair partner stepped over him."

When she learned about the ways the Pacific Lumber Company's practices were damaging the environment, Hill decided to stage a protest.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julia-Butterfly-Hill)
2. [You might know her as Madame Tussaud, but Marie Grosholtz was the woman behind those iconic wax figures. Grosholtz was born in France in 1761, where she developed an interest in wax figures. She worked as an apprentice under Philippe Curtius, a Swiss master of wax anatomy. Under his guidance, Grosholtz began not only making casts of internal body parts but also modeled the outward appearances of public figures.](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/04/madame-tussaud-edward-carey-little)
3. [Barbara Jordan was both one of the first Black women and the first LGBTQ+ woman in Congress. Jordan became close with President Lyndon B. Johnson, who appointed her to key positions in Congress and placed her on the House Judiciary Committee. During President Nixon's impeachment trial, Jordan memorably delivered the opening statement, during which she emphasized the way Black Americans were not initially included in the ""We the people"" statement and were still fighting for equality. This passionate speech led her to become the first Black woman to deliver the keynote address at a Democratic National Convention.](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/barbara-c-jordan)
4. [Frances Perkins became the first female Secretary of Labor after witnessing the horrors of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Perkins was having tea with friends in New York City when she heard sirens. She followed them to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where she witnessed dozens of women jumping out of the building to escape the fire. Soon after, Perkins became dedicated to labor causes, and was hired as the executive secretary of a citizen's safety committee on the recommendation of President Theodore Roosevelt.](https://francesperkinscenter.org/life-new/)
5. [Millvina Dean was the youngest survivor of the Titanic and ended up being the last living survivor of the tragedy before her death in 2009. Dean was just 9 weeks old when the Titanic sunk in 1912. Legend has it that Dean's mother and older brother got a lifeboat and waited for the infant to be lowered down to them in a canvas mailbag. Dean's father stayed behind and did not survive. When the story about Dean's survival broke, she became a pint-sized celebrity. After landing in America, Dean's mother decided she would return to England with her children.](https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/titanic-survivor-millvina-dean-facts)

Baker, whose parents were also performers, made a name for herself as a dancer in vaudeville shows. She moved to New York City and was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance, until she headed to Paris, where her fame exploded. By the time World War II dawned, Baker had decided she wanted to take part in the war effort, and served as a French spy.](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/josephine-baker)
7. [Charlotte Cushman was a 19th-century theater icon who challenged gender roles. As a young woman, Cushman trained for the opera after being encouraged by her mother, and went on to star in several operas before her singing voice began to deteriorate. Cushman decided to turn to traditional stage acting, where she began playing men in Shakespearean plays, including Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet in Hamlet.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charlotte-Saunders-Cushman)

She also was known for developing improved Geiger counters, which were instrumental in detecting radiation levels.](https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/chien-shiung-wu)
9. [Before the 1950s, most TV programming for children was strictly for entertainment and didn't have much, if any, educational value. In 1952, TV execs sought to change this and asked Frances Horwich, a teacher who had been known for supervising the development of preschools in Chicago following the Great Depression, to host Ding Dong School, a show designed to both educate and entertain. The first episode of the show aired in Chicago in October 1952, and soon the network was flooded with letters about how much their children loved the show. Within months, NBC decided to broadcast Ding Dong School all over the country.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/history/ct-opinion-flashback-ding-dong-school-frances-horwich-20210514-j3ffhhvg7rgohgot2awuy5yadu-story.html)

Under her leadership, the tribe experienced unprecedented growth. Mankiller was born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, which is the capital of the Cherokee Nation, but moved to San Francisco with her family after her father was offered a job as part of a government effort to relocate Native Americans, which she described as her ""own personal Trail of Tears."" Mankiller became involved in activism when a group of Native Americans took over the federal penitentiary on Alcatraz Island to demonstrate the suffering of their people.](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/wilma-mankiller)

Prior to Switzer, no woman had ever signed up for the marathon, even though there was no official rule preventing her from racing. She used the name “K. V.

When Bates was 3 years old, her mother was killed by three white men in a racially motivated incident. As Bates grew up and understood the situation, she vowed to devote her life to racial justice. After getting married, Bates and her husband settled in Little Rock, Arkansas, where they started one of the only Black newspapers devoted to the civil rights movement. She also worked closely with the NAACP, and eventually gained notoriety for her work when she became president of the organization's Arkansas chapter.](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/daisy-bates)
13. [Rose Cleveland was the first LGBTQ+ First Lady. Rose served as First Lady during her brother Grover Cleveland's presidency because he was unmarried. During the time period, unmarried presidents had to select a female relative to fill in as First Lady.

◇ COPYRIGHT ◇

&#x200B;

Copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States. Some jurisdictions require “fixing” copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. \[better source needed\] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution. Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered “territorial rights”. This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction.

◇ MOVIES / FILM ◇

&#x200B;

Movies, or films, are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or teach people something. Most people watch (view) movies as a type of entertainment or a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid. It is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity. However, Parc argues that contrary to prevailing beliefs, imitation and copying do not restrict cultural creativity or diversity but in fact support them further. This argument has been supported by many examples such as Millet and Van Gogh, Picasso, Manet, and Monet, etc. Most movies are made so that they can be shown on screen in Cinemas and at home. After movies are shown in Cinemas for a period of a few weeks or months, they may be marketed through several other medias. They are shown on pay television or cable television, and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. You can also download or stream movies.

The students at school barely know either of them because they hardly interact with the kids unless it’s for some big event or if they’re in trouble. 

The teachers are already at their wit’s end due to: Government policies, Covid-19, challenging parents, local cost of living increases, mandatory unpaid training requirements appearing left and right, having to sponsor clubs/stay late/work through textbooks’ worth of paperwork for each student, overpacked classrooms, and so much more. Throw in these two principals who seem to just kick them while they’re down, and they’ve had enough.

I'm wondering how much of student behavior issues fall on the teacher and their competence with classroom management, or if there are some issues that simply can't be resolved because the school simply does not care?  I currently work in a bilingual school in SE Asia, and the behavior can be off the charts.  The school itself doesn't seem to really care what students do, they're frequently left unsupervised in rooms (with free access to YouTube on projectors), allowed to basically run free in the halls and wrestle/play/scream between classes, and it just feels like an unsupervised daycare center much of the time.  I know my classroom management skills need work, but I don't think they're that terrible either.  Some days I just don't know what to do with these kids (grades 3 and 4) because they seem to be taught by the school that rules don't matter and there will be no consequences for behavior (which is basically true).  In your opinion, is this my own fault as a teacher, the school's fault, or a combination?"

628,14,10otvtm,Toronto School of Management,I make $80k a year in Toronto and I can't afford to live by myself... How do you manage housing?,askTO,MargerineFly,2023-01-30 00:32:12,583,"I've only been able to afford room housing until now. 

But I got a new job which was basically a $35k raise. Hurray!

So I start crunching the numbers... I want a reasonable budget. 

80k per year is about $56,000 a year net after taxes. It's about $55,000 a year after my union dues. After pension contribution, I'm looking at about a net income of $45,000 - $50,000. I will know more details when I get my first paycheck (my first second AND third paycheck will be lumped into 1 because HR is understaffed, so I don't get know precisely how much will be taken). 

Let's be very conservative and assume it's $45k a year I'm making. 

Following the adage that you should spend no more than 30% of your income on housing, that leaves me with $15,000 to spend per year on housing. Divided monthly, that's $1250 that I have to spend per month. 

Keeping in mind, of course, that this housing expense should encompass more than rent, but also utilities. If I'm renting, maintenance can assumed to be the landlords responsibility for the most part. I'll just assume that renters insurance falls under another category.

I cannot find anything within a reasonable distance to work that allows me to spend $1250 without roommates. If I can find something within walking distance to work, I'm happy to spend $100 more a month, as I probably won't need a TTC monthly pass. 

 But I still have debts to pay (accumulated student debt during Covid) and I'd like to finally have a car. I'd like to start contributing to an RRSP and a TFSA. I've never gone on a vacation before (I've never had a full paid week off in my adult life), and I'd like to start saving for one, even if it's only $50/week. 

I don't mind living in a basement, but I'm at the point where I don't want roommates because I can never find someone who cleans up after themselves in the kitchen. 

I'm making 80k a year now... I still can't afford to live on my own.

How are you guys managing?"

I'm really really tired of my situation (and the situation of this country) and want neither work in this area nor live in this country anymore. The days keeps passing by as I try to figure out what can I do for a living, then I thought about the market of data science as a whole. I know it's market is heated and almost every company has it's data specialists, so maybe it could be a good idea on investing in this career. Very nice, I have some friends who are studying on colleges in Canada so I think to myself ''hmm maybe I could do the same'', so I asked them about their life and study in Canada (particularly Toronto) and they recommended me to look at the website of their colleges. One really caught my attention and it's called TSoM (Toronto School of Management) which has a co-op data analytics program (1-year duration / diploma). Got excited by beginning this whole new life in another country and career but I have some critical doubts about this plan of mine:

1 - Is this college any good? It could help me build my new career?

2 - How's the market for data analysts specifically in Toronto? Do I as a foreigner and new to this area have any real chances in getting hired after completing this program? (I'm looking forward to get sponsored by a company to get a 3-year work permit, I really want to get out of my country of origin)

P.S: I already began studying programming, database and statistics by Udemy and Coursera, I'm the type of guy who strives for success.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm having trouble retaining guidance for the vast number of conditions and understanding the NICE guidance because of all the different scenarios which change treatment. 

I would have liked to use my lectures for the guidance, but because we are only paying 9.5k a year, the university has decided that it's not going to put effort into updating lecture slides for guidance so a lot of the information is wrong in them and years out of date.

We are very strict, students and parents are given a firm line on the respect expected towards staff, and that they will receive a punishment if they misbehave. It’s a joy to work at, and the children are incredibly happy in that environment. 

We’ve recently agreed to take over a similar school, in-take the same, very similar demographics but the school has been using “positive behaviour management” over the past 3 years and has gone from “outstanding” to special measures in that time. The new headteacher decided that punishments were cruel and not fit for teaching and went full “When the adults change…blah blah blah”. 

We’re now taking it over and are going to revert to our methods that have worked in countless deprived schools in our area. 

My question is, does anyone work in a school where this Paul Dix promoted discipline structure actually works? How can a restorative conversation be any kind of incentive for a child to improve?

652,38,zwp4ie,Toronto School of Management,BDSism at University of Toronto Medical School,IsraelPalestine,JeffB1517,2022-12-27 15:24:05,43,"Been a while since we've had a BDS update.  The BDSers have been more quiet since the Israeli election, which has limited the recent news.  But this week we got a story.  Ayelet Kuper is the Senior Advisor on Anti-Semitism  at the  University of Toronto’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine (TFOM).  She's completed her study, and has published the results [Reflections on addressing antisemitism in a Canadian faculty of medicine](https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/cmej/article/view/76086/56314).  University of Toronto has had a huge upsurge in active BDSism and consequently a huge upsurge in antisemitism.  Kuper was appointed after 2 notable incidents and asked to write a factual report on the situation. 

I'm going to summarize the findings.   I'll as per my norm use the term BDSer, BDSism, BDS for the entire panoply of campus anti-Zionist groups. 

* There was a common belief that the ""growing antisemitism at TFOM was triggered by the war in Gaza in the spring of 2021... TFOM’s  ‘antisemitism  problem is  Israel government  policy"".  The timeline of incidents contradicts this finding as the number of incidents increased it did not decrease in 2022 at roughly the same rate it had been increasing in 2018, 2019, 2020...  

* **Faculty** believe that Jews, even historically should not be included in oppressed groups example complaints that “*those Jews who think their Holocaust means they know something about oppression*”.  

* * There were faculty members who believed there were antisemitism problems at the school.  But believed that ""Antisemitism could not be addressed in a teaching session they controlled because such teaching might normalize the existence of a Jewish state in Israel, which would be **beyond the bounds of acceptable speech.**""

* Beliefs by students were even more bizarre for example that Jewish students had control over the dorm allocation. 

* Supposedly anti-Israel activism is ""rife with dog-whistles and traditional  antisemitic  tropes"".  For example focusing on the university offering kosher food in the cafeteria, 

* Due to BDSism those who express open anti-Jewish hatred ""do so proudly"" though when challenged ""hiding behind the Palestinian cause all the while"" (i.e. BDSism is used to legitimize normative domestic antisemitism).

* Zionism is a term simply means a belief that Jews are entitled to self determination.  Zionist is functionally used as a synonym for Jews.  BDSers willfully engage in deliberate mis-defining it “hating  all  Muslims”,  “wanting  to  murder  all Palestinians""... so as to legitimize anti-Zionist (anti-Jewish) bigotry. 

* Due to the relentless psychological pressure exerted on them many Jewish medical students expressed  ""deep embarrassment at being Jewish"".  
* * * Canadian Jews due to the hostile climate have developed a fear of coordinated mass attack by anti-Jewish groups using AI powered identification. 


* Viciously  antisemitic organizations recruit a small number of Jews to give them protection for all manner of activities and expressions which the Kuper refers to as ""Jew washing"".  The goal of these recruitments is to cause bystanders to become confused as to actions they would clearly identify as antisemitic were this small contingent of complicit Jews not involved.  This strategy was a success in Kuper's report.

* Incidents by faculty (especially BDS affiliated Jewish faculty) to promote antisemitism
* * Specifically trying to discount historical antisemitism as not-antisemitism.  Insinuating the only reason to discuss them is to promote opposition to Palestinians engaging in similar behaviors.
* * Lying to students about University policy.  In this case they were  falsely claiming that the University of Toronto had forbidden  reference  to  the  International  Holocaust Remembrance  Alliance’s  Working  Definition  of Antisemitism (this is approved by the Ontario government, but had not passed a University motion).  That is they were lying to Jewish students about their civil rights protections under Ontario law so they would not exercise those rights. 
* * insinuating that there was a secret cabal of Jews organizing the standing up to antisemitism rather than accepting this was normative behavior of a group to attacks on that group.

* Among non-Jewish faculty common BDSist beliefs were:
* * Jews being pushy and demanding 
* * Jews are in charge when they weren't
* *  Jews having (or wanting) lots of money, 
* * Jews only looking out for other Jews

* Sensitivity training is excluding Jews entirely at TFOM. 
* * TFOM faculty believe in race as a social not a biological construct.  Whiteness implies social power,  Jews are white.  Hence TFOM essentially teaches that Jews have always been among the powerful group doing the oppressing.
* * When confronted by rejections of their theory of whiteness (in particular: the Jewish role in the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, QAnon-related conspiracy theory that Jews are kidnapping Christian children to use their blood and to sexually assault them i.e. blood liber, and rampant  antisemitism  among  the  white  supremacist groups) no willingness to change opinion.  Indicating (IMHO) willful deception.

* Kuper herself was frequently attacked, ""dehumanizing  me,  calling  me  out  as  racist  for defending  myself  against  racism,  and  ascribing  to  me sinister, hidden power.""
